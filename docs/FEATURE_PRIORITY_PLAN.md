# OpenIDX Feature Priority Implementation Plan

> **⚠️ Status note (2026-05-20): much of this plan is already implemented.**
> This was an early competitor-analysis wishlist. As of now, the "critical"
> features below are **shipped**, not pending:
> - **Passwordless / WebAuthn-FIDO2** — built (`internal/identity` WebAuthn
>   handlers, `mfa_webauthn` tables, admin Security Keys page).
> - **Push notification MFA** — built (`internal/mfa` push, `mfa_push_*`
>   tables, admin Push Devices page).
> - **Adaptive / risk-based auth** — built (`internal/risk`, admin Risk
>   Policies / Risk Dashboard / Login Anomalies pages).
> - **SCIM provisioning, AD/LDAP directories, JIT provisioning** — built
>   (`internal/provisioning`, `internal/directory`, provisioning rules).
>
> Treat the items below as historical context, not an active backlog. The
> current near-term priorities are in `docs/PROJECT-STATUS.md` (stabilize +
> make deployable), not net-new IAM features. Re-derive any real feature-gap
> analysis against the live code before using this list.

## Quick Summary

Based on the original competitor analysis, OpenIDX was assessed at ~65%
feature parity. That assessment is now stale — the top features it flagged
have since been implemented (see the status note above).

## 🔴 Critical Features (Must Implement)

### 1. Passwordless Authentication (WebAuthn/FIDO2)
**Priority**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Highest)
**Effort**: Medium (2-3 weeks)
**Impact**: Security teams consider this mandatory for 2026

**What it does**:
- Users log in with biometrics, security keys, or passkeys instead of passwords
- 91% reduction in phishing attacks
- 50% faster login experience
- Works with Windows Hello, Touch ID, Face ID, YubiKey, etc.

**Implementation**:
- Add WebAuthn registration endpoints
- Store credential public keys in database
- Implement authentication verification
- Update frontend with passkey enrollment UI
- Add fallback to existing TOTP

---

### 2. Push Notification MFA
**Priority**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Highest)
**Effort**: Medium (2-3 weeks, requires mobile app or integration)
**Impact**: Expected by 90% of users

**What it does**:
- Users approve login by tapping a notification on their phone
- Displays anti-phishing number for verification
- Better UX than typing TOTP codes
- Works like Duo Push, Okta Verify, or MS Authenticator

**Implementation Options**:
- **Option A**: Build native mobile app (iOS/Android)
- **Option B**: Integrate with existing authenticators (Google Authenticator, Authy)
- **Option C**: Use Firebase Cloud Messaging for custom notifications

---

### 3. Adaptive/Risk-Based Authentication
**Priority**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Highest)
**Effort**: High (4-6 weeks, requires ML integration)
**Impact**: Reduces MFA prompts by 70% while improving security

**What it does**:
- Analyzes login risk based on location, device, behavior, time
- Only prompts MFA when risk is detected
- Learns user patterns over time
- Blocks suspicious logins automatically

**Implementation**:
- Build risk scoring engine (IP reputation, device fingerprinting, time patterns)
- Add ML model for anomaly detection (simple: rule-based, advanced: ML)
- Implement dynamic MFA challenge based on risk score
- Add admin dashboard for risk insights

---

### 4. Directory Synchronization (Active Directory/LDAP)
**Priority**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Highest)
**Effort**: High (4-6 weeks)
**Impact**: Unlocks 80% of enterprise market

**What it does**:
- Automatically syncs users and groups from Active Directory or LDAP
- Bi-directional synchronization (changes flow both ways)
- Conflict resolution (handles updates from both systems)
- Essential for enterprises migrating to cloud IAM

**Implementation**:
- Build LDAP/AD connector service
- Implement sync scheduler (every 5 mins, hourly, daily)
- Add attribute mapping configuration
- Build conflict resolution logic
- Add sync status dashboard

---

### 5. Just-In-Time (JIT) Access Provisioning
**Priority**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (High)
**Effort**: Medium (2-3 weeks)
**Impact**: Cyber insurance requirement by 2025

**What it does**:
- Grants temporary access for a specific time period
- Automatically revokes access when time expires
- Supports elevated privileges on-demand
- Critical for zero-trust architecture

**Implementation**:
- Add time-bound access grants (start_time, end_time)
- Build automatic revocation scheduler
- Add JIT request workflow (optional approval)
- Implement privilege escalation policies
- Add audit trail for JIT access

---

## 🟡 Important Features (Should Implement)

### 6. Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR)
**Priority**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (High)
**Effort**: Low (1-2 weeks)
**Impact**: Reduces help desk calls by 40%

**What it does**:
- Users reset forgotten passwords without IT help
- Verify identity with email, SMS, or security questions
- Immediate ROI on IT support costs

---

### 7. Social Login Integration (OAuth 2.0)
**Priority**: ⭐⭐⭐ (Medium)
**Effort**: Low (1-2 weeks)
**Impact**: Quick win for user experience

**What it does**:
- "Sign in with Google", "Sign in with GitHub", etc.
- Reduces registration friction
- No password management needed

---

### 8. Access Request Workflows
**Priority**: ⭐⭐⭐ (Medium)
**Effort**: Medium (3-4 weeks)
**Impact**: Automates 60% of access provisioning tasks

**What it does**:
- Users request access through self-service portal
- Managers approve/reject requests
- Automatic provisioning after approval
- Full audit trail

---

### 9. User Behavior Analytics (UBA)
**Priority**: ⭐⭐⭐ (Medium)
**Effort**: High (6-8 weeks, requires ML)
**Impact**: Detects insider threats and compromised accounts

**What it does**:
- Learns normal user behavior patterns
- Alerts on anomalies (login from new country, unusual data access)
- Prevents insider threats
- Real-time risk scoring

---

### 10. API Documentation & Developer Portal
**Priority**: ⭐⭐⭐ (Medium)
**Effort**: Low (1 week for auto-generation)
**Impact**: Critical for API adoption

**What it does**:
- Auto-generate Swagger/OpenAPI docs from code
- Interactive API testing interface
- Code samples in multiple languages
- Improves developer experience
