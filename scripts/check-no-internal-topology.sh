# Blocks site-specific internal topology from entering this PUBLIC repository.
#
# Why this exists: while fixing an allow-list, a real deployment's LAN gateway
# address and its subnet breakdown were committed here, and a live internal
# proxy IP was used as test data. Neither is a credential, so secret scanners
# do not flag them -- but a gateway plus its subnet layout is an internal
# network map, and a site-specific value baked into a shared script silently
# misconfigures every OTHER deployment that runs it.
#
# SCOPE, stated honestly:
#   - This gates NEW changes (--staged / PR diffs). It does NOT claim the
#     existing tree is exhaustively clean; the repo carries many legitimate
#     placeholder addresses in UI hints, docs and fixtures.
#   - It checks internal ADDRESSES, not domain names. Whether this project's
#     own domain belongs in a public repo is a separate decision.
#   - It is a heuristic. It is deliberately biased toward silence: a checker
#     that fires on every 192.168.1.1 placeholder gets disabled within a week,
#     and then it protects nothing.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-no-internal-topology.sh --staged        # pre-commit hook
#   scripts/check-no-internal-topology.sh --range <base>  # CI, diff vs base
#   scripts/check-no-internal-topology.sh --all           # advisory sweep

  These are not secrets, which is exactly why scanners miss them.

  Fix by either:
    - moving the value to an environment variable with a generic default
      (see MGMT_ALLOW_CIDRS in deployments/apisix-edge/seed-edge-routes.sh), or
    - using an RFC5737 documentation range in tests/examples:
      198.51.100.0/24, 203.0.113.0/24, 192.0.2.0/24, or
    - appending "topology-ok" to the line if it is genuinely required.
