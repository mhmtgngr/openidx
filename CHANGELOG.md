# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenIDX are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.26.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- **PAM connection manager — RDM parity (#437)** — a Remote Desktop Manager-style privileged
  connection tree for brokered, passwordless sessions:
  - Folders/entries model (`pam_folders`, `pam_entries`) with tags, per-entry policy flags
    (`allow_reveal`, `require_approval`, `record_session`), grants (`pam_entry_grants`),
    favorites, access requests, and a session ledger (`pam_entry_sessions`) — all org-scoped
    under FORCE RLS.
  - Import path for existing connection inventories and a launch path that opens brokered
    sessions without exposing the underlying vault credential.
  - New **PAM Connections** console page (`/pam-connections`) and API client wiring; nav entry
    under the Privileged Access section.
  - CR/LF scrubbing on user-derived values in the import/launch log lines.

### Migrations

- **v81** (additive) — `pam_folders`, `pam_entries`, `pam_entry_grants`, `pam_entry_favorites`,
  `pam_entry_access_requests`, `pam_entry_sessions` with per-table org-scope RLS policies and
  `openidx_app` grants.

## [1.25.0] - 2026-07-12

Large security-and-correctness release (workstreams WS-01…WS-05) plus cross-pillar
correlation, OAuth signing-key rotation, PAM self-service, and a substantial dead-code
purge. Schema advances **v68 → v80** (migrations v69–v80, all additive). Deployed to the
reference box via a full catch-up (schema v68→v80, 8-binary swap); functional sweep of all
services clean.

### Security

- **OAuth step-up MFA bypass closed (WS-01)** — the step-up flow no longer rubber-stamps MFA,
  and MFA-gating can't be bypassed; the authorize-consent subject is derived from the session,
  not the request body.
- **Cross-tenant IDOR fixes (WS-03)** — tenant-scoped `published_apps`/`discovered_paths`,
  `temp_access_links`, and `device_trust_requests`; `GET /organizations` no longer enumerates
  other tenants and org write paths are authorized; Elasticsearch audit search is tenant-scoped;
  portal device registration now stamps the caller's `org_id` (was mis-tenanted to the default org).
- **Minted API keys now actually authenticate requests (WS-03)** — previously issued keys were inert.
- **Separation-of-duty enforced and fail-closed (WS-05)** — SoD policies are evaluated at
  access-request fulfillment and in identity; evaluation failures fail closed.
- **Fail-open hardening** — `CheckPolicies` fails closed when org context is absent; three
  fail-open error paths in the live security checks are closed. Approval policies'
  `auto_approve_conditions` evaluate fail-closed.
- **Log-injection sanitization** — CR/LF and user-derived values scrubbed from cross-pillar,
  step-up MFA, and IBDR/continuous-auth log lines (CodeQL).

### Added

- **Cross-pillar correlation** — correlate IAM, PAM, and Ziti per user: unified access map,
  kill switch, and lifecycle propagation; a user's devices are correlated across IAM trust and
  Ziti compliance.
- **OAuth DB-backed signing-key rotation** — `oauth_signing_keys` (migration v79) backs rotatable
  RS256 signing keys.
- **Governance (WS-05)** — audit + session-kill on access-review revocation; manager-based
  reviewer resolution; `org_id` + FORCE RLS on certification/ABAC tables; JIT expiry now revokes
  application access.
- **Provisioning** — provisioning rules are evaluated on SCIM user create/update (safe additive
  subset); SCIM `filter` applied in `ListSCIMUsers`/`ListSCIMGroups`.
- **Audit** — `detailed_compliance_reports` table (migration v74) with org-scoped evidence access;
  GDPR report routed; WebAuthn MFA counted from `mfa_webauthn` in SOC2/ISO metrics.
- **Identity** — `known_devices.device_type` (migrations v75/v76) so corporate-device
  auto-approval works.
- **PAM finalization — end-user self-service** — non-admin users get a first-class PAM surface:
  - `GET /api/v1/access/guacamole/my-connections` — org-scoped catalog of brokered Guacamole
    connections with the PAM flags the launcher needs (approval required / recorded /
    credential injected); never exposes the vault secret id or Guacamole-internal identifiers.
  - `GET /api/v1/access/guacamole/my-session-requests` — the caller's own session requests
    (previously only admins could list requests), joined with route info so an approved
    request can be launched.
  - New **My Privileged Access** console page (`/my-privileged-access`, in the user nav):
    launch/request brokered remote sessions, track request status, and manage JIT credential
    checkouts (one-shot retrieve + early return) in one place.
- **PAM finalization — management dashboard** — new aggregated stats endpoint
  `GET /api/v1/pam/overview` (admin-api, admin-guarded; explicit org predicates on top of
  FORCE-RLS) covering vault inventory by type, rotation health (enabled/failing/overdue
  policies, 30-day runs/failures), checkout activity (active leases, 30-day checkouts,
  pending JIT credential requests), and privileged sessions (active, 30-day, pending
  approvals, recordings on legal hold). New **PAM Dashboard** console page
  (`/pam-dashboard`) renders it with health labels and manage links; linked from the
  dashboard's Privileged Access card and the Privileged Access nav section.

### Changed

- **Admin PAM routes are now role-gated client-side** — `/pam-dashboard`, `/vault-secrets`,
  `/rotation-policies`, and `/guacamole-sessions` no longer mount for non-admins (redirect
  to the dashboard); the backend 403 remains the enforcement layer. Vault Secrets and
  Privileged Sessions now render a friendly "admin access required" state on 403 (matching
  Rotation Policies) instead of a generic failure.
- **Legal-hold reasons via a proper dialog** — the Session History place/release legal-hold
  flow uses an accessible reason dialog (reason required to place a hold) instead of
  `window.prompt`.

### Fixed

- **Governance revocation actually revokes** — access-review revoke decisions now revoke access;
  role-based approval steps get real approvers; stopped silent audit loss on JIT grant/expiry.
- **"Phantom table" correctness sweep** — features now read the real schema instead of
  never-created tables: MFA/WebAuthn metrics from `mfa_webauthn` (not `webauthn_credentials`),
  GDPR consent from `user_consents` (not `consent_records`), user groups from `group_memberships`
  (not `user_groups`), breach detection and continuous auth on real tables, MFA method status and
  biometric/passwordless from real enrollment tables.
- **Risk** — admin-configured risk policies are applied (was a `parseJSON` no-op); device tracking
  uses real `known_devices` columns; `GetUserDevices` no longer silently drops rows with NULL text
  columns.
- **Dashboard** — dropped a non-existent `users.deleted_at` predicate that errored and made the
  admin dashboard silently report zero users (#435).
- **Admin console** — reads the bare-array `/organizations` response so the tenant UI renders (WS-03).

### Removed

- **Dead-code purge (~8.8k+ lines)** — deleted five never-wired subsystems and additional dead
  paths: the OAuth `KeyManager` and its phantom `oauth_signing_keys` layer, the unrouted
  `CertificationService` and WebAuthn subsystem, the never-functional admin passwordless subsystem,
  the dead AI policy-recommendations route, and orphaned CSV-import handlers.

### Migrations

- **v69–v80** (all additive): governance org-isolation (v69), `users.manager_id` (v70),
  `temp_access_links`/`device_trust_requests`/`published_apps` tenant isolation (v71–v73),
  `detailed_compliance_reports` (v74), `known_devices.device_type`/`seen_count` (v75/v76),
  session-risk history (v77), recording retention policies (v78), `oauth_signing_keys` (v79),
  enrolled-agent ↔ known-device link (v80).

## [1.24.11] - 2026-07-09

### Changed

- **tailwind-merge 2→3** (#54, flagged dependabot runtime major) — used only via the default
  `twMerge(clsx(...))` `cn()` helper, so v3's custom-config breaking changes don't apply. Validated by
  `vite build`, eslint, and 730 vitest tests; admin-console dist rebuilt + deployed.

## [1.24.10] - 2026-07-09

### Changed

- **Frontend build/type tooling majors** — `@types/node` 22→25, `globals` 15→17, `@vitejs/plugin-react`
  4→5 (from the flagged dependabot backlog). `tsc`+`vite build` clean, `eslint` 0 errors; admin-console
  dist rebuilt + deployed. `eslint` 9→10 is **deferred** — the eslint-10 ecosystem isn't ready
  (`eslint-plugin-react-hooks` peer-requires eslint≤9; eslint 10 drops bundled `@eslint/js`).

## [1.24.9] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- **SSO audit events now counted in compliance reports & statistics** (#392) — the OIDC SSO audit
  events added in v1.24.7/v1.24.8 used `event_type=sso.login` (with `category=authentication`),
  backwards from the platform convention where authentication events use `event_type=authentication`
  and the compliance/statistics queries filter on it. As a result SSO activity was excluded from
  compliance reports and failed-auth stats. Normalized all OIDC SSO events to
  `event_type=authentication`, `category=sso` (the `sso.*` descriptor is retained as the `action`,
  e.g. `sso_login`, `sso_user_provisioned`), so SSO logins/failures are counted like every other
  authentication event.

## [1.24.8] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- **Failed-login audit for SSO/SAML** (#388, #389) — the OIDC callback and SAML IdP SSO handler
  now emit `outcome=failure` audit events at every failure exit (OIDC: invalid_state,
  token_exchange_failed, id_token_verification_failed, missing_email_claim, provisioning_failed;
  SAML: invalid_authn_request, unknown_service_provider, acs_url_mismatch, sp_disabled,
  response_build_failed). This surfaces attacks/misconfiguration (forged tokens, unregistered-SP
  probing, ACS-URL tampering) in the audit trail, complementing the success events from v1.24.7.
- **Audit events queryable by target** (#390) — `GET /api/v1/audit/events` now honours a
  `target_id` filter (the `AuditQuery.TargetID` field was previously unused), so auditors can scope
  the trail to everything affecting a specific user or resource.

### Changed

- **Dependency bumps** (#386, #387) — `go.uber.org/zap` 1.27→1.28, `pquerna/otp` 1.4→1.5,
  `spf13/viper` 1.18→1.21; frontend `autoprefixer`, `lucide-react`, `eslint-plugin-react-refresh`.
  Part of clearing the dependabot backlog (superseded/stale PRs closed; major bumps flagged for review).

## [1.24.7] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- **SSO/OAuth audit events are now persisted** (#384) — the oauth service's `logAuditEvent`
  previously logged only to the application log, so SSO/OAuth/SAML activity (logins, logouts,
  single-logout, JIT provisioning) never reached the `audit_events` table and was absent from the
  audit query API (`GET /api/v1/audit/events`) and compliance reports. It now persists to
  `audit_events` (async, org-scoped, best-effort — never blocks or fails the request), matching the
  identity service's pattern; the application log is retained.
- **SSO JIT lifecycle audit trail** (#384) — the OIDC callback now emits `sso.user.provisioned`,
  `sso.identity.linked`, `sso.identity.matched`, `sso.identity.backfilled`, and `sso.login`,
  giving a queryable record of how SSO accounts are provisioned, federated-linked, and
  authenticated (builds on the federated-identity work in v1.24.4–v1.24.6).

## [1.24.6] - 2026-07-08

### Changed

- **Backfill the federated identity link for email-matched JIT users** (#369) — completes the
  #364/#367 migration: when a returning OIDC user is matched by email (created before the
  `idp_id`/`external_user_id` binding existed), the login handler now best-effort backfills those
  columns (only when currently unset), so subsequent logins match by `(idp_id, sub)`. Keyed by the
  matched `users.id`; nil-guarded and error-logged, never affects login.

## [1.24.5] - 2026-07-08

### Changed

- **OIDC JIT provisioning matches returning users by IdP subject before email** (#367) — the login
  handler now looks an existing user up by `(idp_id, sub)` first (explicitly org-scoped), falling
  back to email, then creating. A federated user whose email changed at the IdP is no longer treated
  as new (which would have created a duplicate colliding with the unique `(idp_id, external_user_id)`
  index #364 populates). Additive: any lookup miss/error falls through to the prior email path, so
  existing behavior is preserved.

## [1.24.4] - 2026-07-08

### Security

- **Go toolchain → go1.25.12** (#363) — the pinned `toolchain go1.25.11` forced builds onto a
  `crypto/tls` affected by **GO-2026-5856**, failing the govulncheck gate and shipping the vulnerable
  TLS stack in binaries. Bumped to go1.25.12 (govulncheck clean).
- **SAML SLO session-cookie cleared with `Secure` in production** (#362) — `clearIdPSession` cleared
  `openidx_session` with `Secure=false` unconditionally; now tied to `IsProduction()` (matching the
  proxy session-cookie convention), so the deletion still clears over plain HTTP in dev while carrying
  `Secure` in production. Clears `go/cookie-secure-not-set`.

### Fixed

- **Capture `Close` errors on writable files** (#361) — three writable-file writers
  (session-recording append, append-only store, shell-completion install) deferred a bare `Close()`,
  discarding the error; for a writable handle the final flush can surface only at `Close`, so this
  silently dropped data. Each now propagates the `Close` error. Clears `go/unhandled-writable-file-close`.
- **Bind JIT-provisioned users to the IdP subject** (#364) — the OIDC login handler captured the ID
  token `sub` but discarded it, leaving `users.idp_id`/`external_user_id` unpopulated. It now persists
  the federated link on JIT create (best-effort, RLS-scoped). Resolves the dropped-value
  `go/useless-assignment-to-field` on `claims.Sub`.
- **Drop dead `entry.Error` assignment in the request logger** (#365) — the access logger emits via
  `logFields`, not by marshalling the entry, so the assignment was never read; the error is still
  logged. Clears `go/useless-assignment-to-field`.

## [1.24.3] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- **Out-of-bounds read in `User.GetFormattedName`** (#359) — the method returned
  `parts[0] + " " + parts[1]` whenever any name component was present, but `parts` holds only one
  element when a user has only a given name or only a family name, so `parts[1]` panicked with an
  index-out-of-range. Now joins the collected parts, which is correct for one or two components.
  Clears the repo's only `error`-severity CodeQL alert (`go/index-out-of-bounds`).

## [1.24.2] - 2026-07-08

### Security

- **Audit report export filename built from allowlisted constants** (#357) — the export file name
  was assembled from the raw request `report_type`/`format` strings, so CodeQL traced
  caller-controlled data to `os.Stat`/`os.Create` even behind the `filepath.Base` + `reportDir`-prefix
  guards it doesn't model. Both fields are already validated against fixed enums; the name is now
  built from a compile-time-constant `typeSlug`/`ext` chosen inside those switches (plus the
  server-generated ID and timestamp), so no request string reaches `filepath.*`. Closes the last
  three `go/path-injection` alerts as fixed — the repo is now at **0 open critical and 0 open high**
  CodeQL alerts. The `reportFilePath` clean+prefix guard remains as defense-in-depth.

## [1.24.1] - 2026-07-08

### Security

- **Audit report export path containment proven to static analysis** (#355) — `reportFilePath`
  already constrained the export file to a single element under `reportDir` via `filepath.Base`
  (#349), but CodeQL does not model `Base`-through-`Join` as a path-injection barrier, so the
  `os.Stat`/`os.Create` sinks stayed flagged. Added an explicit `filepath.Clean` + `reportDir`-prefix
  check (returning an error the caller handles) so containment is provable to static analysis,
  closing the three `go/path-injection` alerts as fixed. With this and the ziti request-forgery
  findings confirmed as trusted-config false positives, the repo is at **0 open critical and
  0 open high** CodeQL alerts.

## [1.24.0] - 2026-07-08

### Security

- **CodeQL critical + high remediation complete.** This release closes the backup-encryption weak-KDF
  (#353) and caps a sweep that brought the repo to **0 open critical and 0 open high** CodeQL alerts —
  via real fixes across v1.23.1–v1.23.5 (integer-overflow env parsing, Ziti management-API SSRF hardening,
  OAuth logout/session JWT signature verification, audit report path-injection, hardware-token secret
  encryption at rest) plus documented false-positive dismissals (HIBP SHA-1 k-anonymity, MySQL DDL,
  trusted-config Ziti base URL, e2e-test regex/randomness, helm empty-password placeholders, dev-profiler
  cert-check) and the structured-`zap`-field log-injection class.
- **Backup encryption KDF → scrypt** (#353) — `internal/backup` derived its AES-256 key from a raw
  `sha256(passphrase)`; it now uses `scrypt` (N=1<<15, r=8, p=1) over a random salt in a versioned,
  magic-prefixed format, with a legacy `sha256` fallback so existing encrypted backups still decrypt.
  Removed the dead `EncryptPassword` helper.

## [1.23.5] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- **Hardware-token secrets encrypted at rest** (#351, security) — the hardware-token (YubiKey OATH-HOTP)
  handler stored the TOTP/HOTP seed as `hex(sha256(secret)) + ":" + secret`, i.e. the seed was
  recoverable in plaintext (the hash prefix was security-theater). It's now encrypted with the identity
  service's AES-256-GCM `secretcrypt` cipher (the KEK-backed cipher already used for IdP client secrets);
  decrypt reads both the new `encv1:` format and the legacy format, so existing rows keep working and
  upgrade on the next write. Clears `go/weak-sensitive-data-hashing` (high).

## [1.23.4] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- **Audit report export path-injection** (#349, security) — the compliance report exporter built its
  output file path from the request-controlled `report_type`/`format` (`filepath.Join(reportDir, fileName)`)
  with no sanitization, so a `report_type`/`format` containing `../` could write/stat a file outside the
  report directory. Now routed through `reportFilePath()`, which applies `filepath.Base` to constrain the
  name to a single element under `reportDir`. Clears `go/path-injection` (high ×3).

## [1.23.3] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- **Ziti management-API request hardening + dependency security bump** (#347) — the generic Ziti
  `mgmtRequest` helper now builds requests through the validated `mgmtURL()` (parses `ZitiCtrlURL`,
  pins scheme+host) instead of raw string concatenation, so a malformed/hostile controller URL cannot
  redirect management calls. Also bumps the indirect `quic-go` dependency v0.59.0→v0.59.1 to resolve
  `GO-2026-5676` (govulncheck). The residual `go/request-forgery` findings on this helper are documented
  false positives (the host is pinned; the appended path holds only internal Ziti resource IDs).

## [1.23.2] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- **JWT signature verification on OAuth logout/session endpoints** (#345, security) — `handleLogoutAll`,
  `handleSessionInfo`, and `handleLogout` (end-session) parsed the caller's JWT with `ParseUnverified`
  and acted on the unverified `sub`, so a forged/unsigned token could revoke another user's sessions or
  read their session info. Added `parseVerifiedClaims` (RS256-pinned signature check against the service
  key, alg-confusion-proof, with an expiry-tolerant mode for the OIDC `id_token_hint`) and routed all
  parse sites through it; logout-all/session-info now return 401 on an unverified token, and end-session
  no longer acts on an unverified subject. Clears `go/missing-jwt-signature-check` (high ×3).

## [1.23.1] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- **CodeQL critical/high remediation** (#343) — (a) `database.go envInt32` now uses
  `strconv.ParseInt(s, 10, 32)` instead of `int32(strconv.Atoi(...))`, fixing a silent integer-overflow
  truncation of pool-sizing env vars (go/incorrect-integer-conversion ×2); (b) the Ziti management-API
  calls route through a new `mgmtURL()` helper that parses + validates `ZitiCtrlURL` (scheme/host) and
  the response-derived identity ID is `url.PathEscape`'d, clearing the server-side request-forgery
  vectors (go/request-forgery). The MySQL `ALTER USER` DDL (which cannot bind identifiers/passwords and
  is charset-validated + escaped) and the Ziti call against the trusted operator-configured controller
  base URL are documented false positives. No runtime behavior change.

## [1.23.0] - 2026-07-07

### Changed

- **Admin console code-splitting follow-ups** (#341) — `lucide-react` and `@tanstack` now build into
  their own cacheable chunks (`icons`, `query`; the `vendor` chunk drops ~1,176→1,071 kB), and the
  `Layout` outlet is wrapped in its own `<Suspense>` so navigating to an unvisited page spins only the
  content area (the sidebar/header stay rendered) instead of a full-screen fallback. Frontend-only.

## [1.22.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **GCP service-account key rotation connector** (#339) — a new `gcp_sa` PAM rotation connector that
  rotates a Google Cloud service-account key, completing the cloud-IAM rotation pair (AWS shipped in
  v1.21.0). It reuses the engine `Minter`/`PostRotateCleaner` seam: `Mint` creates a new key via the IAM
  API (deleting the oldest USER_MANAGED key first if at GCP's 10-key limit) and stores the decoded
  key-file JSON; `Verify` obtains an OAuth token from the new key (retrying for propagation); cleanup
  deletes all USER_MANAGED keys except the newest after promotion. Selectable from the Rotation Policies
  admin page. Config: `service_account_email`, `admin_secret_id` (a vault secret holding an admin SA
  key-file JSON). The target service account must be dedicated to rotation. Google IAM calls sit behind
  a small interface so the connector is covered by mocked-SDK unit tests. Adds `google.golang.org/api`.

## [1.21.1] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- **CodeQL `go/unsafe-quoting` (critical) in AD `unicodePwd` encoding** (#337) — `encodePasswordAD`
  built the Active Directory password value by concatenating double quotes around the password
  (`"\"" + password + "\""`) before UTF-16LE encoding. The encoded bytes are sent as a binary LDAP
  attribute in a `ModifyRequest` (never interpolated into a filter/DN/parsed context), so this was not
  exploitable, but the pattern is now rewritten to a single bounded allocation that writes the quote
  code units directly — clearing the alert (and an allocation-size-overflow on the same function) with
  byte-identical output. Added byte-exact and embedded-quote regression tests.

## [1.21.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **AWS IAM access-key rotation connector** (#335) — a new `aws_iam` PAM rotation connector that rotates
  an IAM user's access keys, selectable from the Rotation Policies admin page. Introduces an engine
  "minter" seam (`Minter` + `PostRotateCleaner`) for providers that mint the secret themselves: the
  connector calls `CreateAccessKey`, verifies the new key via STS `GetCallerIdentity` (retrying for IAM
  eventual consistency), and retires the superseded key only after the new one is promoted. AWS calls
  sit behind small interfaces so the connector is covered by mocked-SDK unit tests. Config:
  `target_user`, `admin_secret_id` (a vault secret holding admin AWS creds as
  `{access_key_id, secret_access_key}` JSON), `region`. The target IAM user must be dedicated to
  rotation (cleanup deletes all its access keys except the newest). GCP service-account keys are a
  planned follow-up on the same seam.

## [1.20.0] - 2026-07-07

### Changed

- **Admin console bundle code-splitting** (#333) — the console shipped as a single ~3.4 MB (875 KB
  gzip) JS chunk. Route pages are now lazy-loaded (`React.lazy` + `<Suspense>`) and `node_modules`
  vendors are split into cacheable chunks via vite `manualChunks`. The initial entry chunk drops from
  ~3,394 KB to ~62 KB (17 KB gzip); heavy libs now load only with the page that needs them
  (`swagger-ui-react` → API-docs page, `recharts` → dashboard). Frontend-only, no behavior change
  beyond a brief loading spinner on first visit to a route.

## [1.19.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **Rotation-policies admin UI — SSH / SSH-key / PostgreSQL / MySQL connectors** (#331) — the Rotation
  Policies page can now create policies for all six registered rotators, not just `directory` and
  `generate_only`. The Connector Type dropdown gains **SSH (password)**, **SSH key-pair**,
  **PostgreSQL**, and **MySQL**, each rendering its required config fields (host, port, admin
  credential secret-picker, target user/role, DB name, SSL/TLS, pinned host key, …) driven by a
  declarative field schema that mirrors the backend validators. The SSH/DB rotation connectors shipped
  in v1.14.0 were previously creatable only via `curl`. Frontend-only — no backend or schema change
  (`connector_config` is a free-form map validated server-side by each connector's `ValidateConfig`).

## [1.18.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- **Guacamole recording legal-hold — admin console UI** (#329) — the Session History table on the
  Guacamole Sessions page now has per-recording **Place hold** / **Release hold** controls (with a
  reason prompt) and an **On hold** badge, wired to the existing legal-hold endpoints
  (`POST/DELETE /api/v1/access/guacamole/sessions/:id/legal-hold`). Previously those endpoints — which
  exempt a held recording from the retention sweeper — could only be driven by `curl`. The
  `session-history` list endpoint now returns two read-only, org-scoped flags (`recording_available`,
  `on_legal_hold`) so the UI can render the correct state. No schema change (uses the v68
  `guacamole_recording_legal_holds` table shipped in v1.15.0).

## [1.17.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- **OpenZiti made easy** (#326) — the Ziti reconciler is now on by default (`ziti_reconciler=true`), the
  dev compose bundles the ZAC console (`ziti_console_url`), the router runs from a version-controlled
  declarative config (`deployments/docker/ziti-router/`) instead of sed/awk-patching at startup, agents
  auto-enroll, and a one-command Ziti quickstart (`scripts/ziti-quickstart.sh` + guided setup page).
- **One-command box deploy script** (#323) — `scripts/deploy-box.sh` automates the release recipe
  (backup → migrate → roll binaries → verify).

### Changed

- **Security hardening** (#324) — access-revocation and privilege checks tightened; OAuth signing keys
  are now **encrypted at rest** (via the prefix-aware `secretcrypt` helper — legacy plaintext keys are
  read transparently and re-encrypted on rotation); SCIM PATCH support extended in provisioning; the
  published default `ziti_admin_password`/`guacamole_admin_password` must be overridden in production
  (new `ValidateProduction` check).
- Dependency bumps: `go-ldap/ldap/v3` 3.4.8→3.4.12 (#325); Docker base images alpine 3.20→3.24 (#262),
  nginx (#93), node (#94). CI now compiles the integration test suite on every build (#73).

## [1.16.1] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- **IAM→Ziti revocation sweep failed on a uuid `user_id`** — the deprovision sweep added in v1.16.0
  queried `WHERE zi.user_id != ''` against the uuid column `ziti_identities.user_id`, which forced an
  empty-string→uuid cast and failed the whole query (`22P02`) every poll, so a disabled user's Ziti
  identity was never deleted. Dropped the redundant `!= ''` (`IS NOT NULL` suffices for a uuid column)
  and added a regression test. Released as a hotfix on top of v1.16.0.

## [1.16.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- **Guided Ziti Network Setup** — new admin-console page **Network Setup** (`/ziti-setup`) that makes
  the OpenZiti onboarding understandable, visual, and self-explanatory:
  - **Topology strip**: Clients → Edge Routers → Control Plane → Applications with live status dots.
  - **Setup checklist**: ordered steps (controller connection, CA trust, access-proxy identity,
    edge routers, app exposure, user-identity sync, client access) — each with live status, plain
    remediation text, and a deep-link action button.
  - **Install advisor**: which pieces must be installed *for this deployment* — controller, edge
    router (with `--tunneler-enabled` enrollment commands), BrowZer bootstrapper, client tunneler /
    OpenIDX Agent, hop nginx — labeled Required / Needed-for-your-setup / Optional.
  - **Per-route advice**: stored vs *effective* hosting mode (with auto-correct warnings), the full
    next-hop data path (`edge router → hop nginx :port → upstream`), what the client side needs,
    per-mode requirements, and the reconciler's live converge state per route.
  Backend: `GET /api/v1/access/ziti/setup/status` (aggregated checklist/advisor/route payload,
  reusing the reconciler's `effectiveHostingMode` + install-wide hop-port map so the UI explains
  exactly what will happen) and `GET /api/v1/access/ziti/reconciler/status` (per-service converge
  state, previously log-only). `/ziti-network` tabs are now deep-linkable via `?tab=`.

### Fixed

- **Ziti reconciler survives admin-panel reconnects** — the reconciler ran on the provider slot's
  context, so `POST /ziti/connect` (which Swaps the slot and cancels that context) silently killed
  the reconcile loop for good; subsequent route changes were never converged. It now runs on a
  process-lifetime context (no-ops while disconnected), and the connect handler wakes it via
  `Enqueue()` instead of imperatively hosting services alongside it — the reconciler stays the
  sole mutator, eliminating the double-hosting 502 path.
- **`PUT /ziti/settings` validates before persisting** — a malformed/empty controller URL or empty
  admin user is now rejected with 400 instead of being saved silently and only failing at the next
  connect. CI: the Benchmarks job could never post its PR comment (workflow token is read-only) and
  failed after the benchmarks had passed; it now has job-level write permission and degrades to a
  warning when the token can't comment.

### Security

- **Disabled/deleted IAM users are deprovisioned from Ziti** — the user-sync poller now sweeps
  Ziti identities whose user is disabled or gone (controller delete + mirror-row delete, batched,
  retried). Previously a revoked user's enrolled tunneler kept a valid Ziti identity — and network
  access — indefinitely. Infrastructure identities (access-proxy, admin, routers) are untouched.

## [1.15.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- **Guacamole recording legal-hold** (#318) — place a legal-hold on a Guacamole session's recording
  so it is never deleted by the retention purger. New `guacamole_recording_legal_holds` table
  (migration **v68**, FK → `guacamole_sessions` with a UNIQUE active-hold index), the recording
  retention sweeper (`sweepExpiredGuacRecordings`) now excludes sessions under an active hold, and
  admin-gated, audited endpoints:
  - `POST   /api/v1/access/guacamole/sessions/:id/legal-hold` (409 if one is already active)
  - `DELETE /api/v1/access/guacamole/sessions/:id/legal-hold`
  - `GET    /api/v1/access/guacamole/sessions/:id/legal-holds`
  Each endpoint verifies the session is visible under the caller's org before acting. Mirrors the
  existing remote-support legal-hold; a testcontainer test proves a held recording survives the
  sweep and is purged once released.

### Upgrade

- Migration **v68** adds a table (additive). Run `cmd/migrate up` (or the compose `migrate` service)
  before/at deploy.

## [1.14.1] - 2026-07-04

### Changed

- **All registered rotation connectors are now creatable via the CreatePolicy API** (#316) —
  `validatePolicyInput` previously accepted only `directory`/`generate_only`, so `ssh`, `postgres`,
  `ssh_key`, and `mysql` rotation policies required a direct DB insert. A new optional
  `ConfigValidator` interface lets each connector validate its own `connector_config` (delegating to
  its existing config parser), and the engine now accepts any **registered** connector type.
  **Note:** the accepted connector-type set is now registration-dependent rather than a hardcoded
  pair; unregistered types are rejected with a clear error.

## [1.14.0] - 2026-07-04

Two new PAM credential-rotation connectors, extending the M5 rotation engine.

### Added

- **SSH key-pair rotation connector** (`ssh_key`) (#313) — rotates a POSIX account's SSH key: the
  stored secret value is a freshly generated ed25519 OpenSSH private key; the derived public key is
  installed into the target's `authorized_keys` (a single tagged line, replaced each rotation) over
  an admin SSH session, and rotation is verified by logging in as the target with the new key. Reuses
  the existing `FixedHostKey` verification. No new dependencies.
- **`ValueGenerator` engine seam** (#313) — an optional interface letting a connector produce the
  secret value itself (e.g. a private key) instead of the engine's default random password. Existing
  connectors are unaffected.
- **MySQL rotation connector** (`mysql`) (#314) — rotates a MySQL user's password via `ALTER USER`,
  authenticating with a bootstrap admin credential from the vault, verified by connecting as the
  target with the new password. New dependency: `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql`. Because MySQL DDL
  cannot bind the password, the connector strictly validates identifiers, escapes the password as a
  single-quoted literal, and strips `NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES` on a pinned connection — verified against
  injection-shaped inputs.

### Notes

- Cloud-IAM (AWS/GCP) rotation is deferred (heavy SDKs, not locally verifiable).
- Follow-up: `validatePolicyInput` accepts only `directory`/`generate_only`, so `ssh`/`postgres`/
  `ssh_key`/`mysql` rotation policies must currently be created out-of-band (pre-existing gap).

## [1.13.1] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed

- **Elasticsearch client validates auth at construction** (#311) — `NewElasticsearchFromConfig`'s
  connectivity ping only inspected the transport error, so a wrong/absent password against a
  security-enabled cluster (a 401/403 with `err == nil`) silently "connected" and then failed every
  operation. It now checks `res.IsError()` and returns a clear error, so bad ES credentials surface at
  startup. Audit-service still treats Elasticsearch as best-effort (warn + continue), so this turns a
  silent operation-time failure into a clear startup warning. Surfaced by the v1.13.0 ES-auth smoke test.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-07-04

Elasticsearch authentication for the docker-compose deploy path — the last deferred item from
the prod-compose hardening bundle. Compose-only; the app-side ES auth was already built.

### Changed

- **Elasticsearch security enabled in prod compose** (#309) — `docker-compose.prod.yml` sets
  `xpack.security.enabled=true` + `xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled=false` + `ELASTIC_PASSWORD` on
  the `elasticsearch` service (HTTP basic auth over the private network), and wires
  `ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME`/`ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD` into `audit-service` (the only ES consumer,
  which already passes them to the auth-aware client). Dev/infra compose keep security disabled.
- **`ValidateProduction` requires ES credentials** (#309) — when `APP_ENV=production` and
  `elasticsearch_url` is set, `elasticsearch_username`/`elasticsearch_password` must be provided
  (conditional, so ES-unused deployments are unaffected).

### Notes

- Baseline is HTTP basic auth; self-signed ES HTTP TLS (parity with the v1.12.0 Postgres TLS) is a
  documented follow-up. Dedicated least-privilege ES roles are also a follow-up (uses the built-in
  `elastic` user for now).
- Upgrade: set `ELASTIC_PASSWORD` and a matching `ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD` in `.env` before a prod
  `docker compose up`.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-07-04

Production-readiness hardening for the docker-compose deploy path. Compose-only —
systemd/managed deployments are unaffected.

### Added

- **Startup readiness probes** (#307) — `internal/common/health.WaitForDependency` (bounded
  retry) plus `ProbeHTTP`/`ProbeOPA`. Services now verify hard dependencies at boot instead of
  returning 500s later: the OPA-using services (admin-api, provisioning, governance) probe
  `OPA/health` and the access service probes its Ziti controller — **fail-fast in production,
  warn and continue in development**. The OPA probe is gated on `EnableOPAAuthz` so a deploy
  that doesn't use OPA never blocks on it; APISIX is intentionally not probed (its reconciler
  already self-heals).
- **Self-signed Postgres TLS in prod compose** (#306) — a `pg-certgen` one-shot service
  generates a server cert (owned uid 70, key mode 0600) into a `pg_certs` volume; the prod
  Postgres runs with `ssl=on`, and the app/migrate/seed DSNs default to
  `sslmode=${DATABASE_SSL_MODE:-require}` so DB traffic is encrypted out of the box. Point at an
  external managed Postgres by setting `DATABASE_SSL_MODE` and supplying your own certs.

### Changed

- **DB pool sizing is configurable** (#306) — `DB_MAX_CONNS`/`DB_MIN_CONNS` (defaults 25/5)
  replace the hardcoded pool limits in `internal/common/database`.
- **APISIX admin key sourced from `APISIX_ADMIN_KEY`** (#306) via native APISIX `${{...}}` env
  substitution (no more `CHANGE_ME_ADMIN_KEY` in the config), wired into all three compose files;
  `admin_allow_ip` tightened to loopback + the container bridge ranges (`10.0.0.0/8`,
  `172.16.0.0/12`).
- **Graceful-shutdown timeout is configurable** (#306) — `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 30)
  replaces the hardcoded 30s across all services.

### Notes

- Elasticsearch `xpack.security` remains deferred (needs ES-client auth wiring).
- Upgrade: the `openidx_app` password hook and now Postgres TLS certs are generated on **first
  init of a fresh `postgres_data` volume**; existing volumes need the operator to provision them
  once (see the v1.11.0 note for the role password).

## [1.11.0] - 2026-07-04

Docker-compose deployments are now tenant-isolated. Previously a fresh
`docker compose up` was pre-multi-tenancy at the schema level (`init-db.sql` had no
RLS belt and app services connected as the `openidx` superuser, which bypasses RLS
entirely). This release makes migrations the sole schema source in compose and cuts
the app services over to the non-owner `openidx_app` role so the FORCE'd RLS
policies enforce — matching the box and managed/RDS deployments.

### Added

- **`migrate` + `seed` one-shot compose services** (#303) — a `migrate` service builds
  the full v1–v67 schema (as the superuser) after Postgres is healthy, then a `seed`
  service applies the functional-delta bootstrap. App services gate on the seed
  completing (`depends_on: service_completed_successfully`). Wired into
  `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`, and `docker-compose.infra.yml`.
- **`deployments/docker/bootstrap.sql`** (#303) — minimal first-init (the passwordless
  `openidx_app` role + `GRANT CONNECT`); migrations own everything else.
- **`deployments/docker/seed.sql`** (#303) — idempotent functional-delta bootstrap
  (`role_permissions` + default risk/posture/privacy/notification/lifecycle/ispm
  policies + tenant branding), org-scoped, applied under `app.bypass_rls`.
- **`deployments/docker/set-app-role-password.sh`** (#304) — first-init hook that sets
  the `openidx_app` password from `OPENIDX_APP_PASSWORD` (sorts after `bootstrap.sql`).
- **`test/integration/compose_seed_test.go`** (#303) — e2e guard: migrate-from-empty →
  `seed.sql` → asserts the login bootstrap and that RLS fails closed for a NOSUPERUSER
  role without an org GUC and returns default-org rows with one set.

### Changed

- **Compose app services connect as `openidx_app`** (NOSUPERUSER, NOBYPASSRLS) (#304),
  so the v37 FORCE-RLS policies enforce. `migrate`/`seed` stay on the `openidx`
  superuser (they own DDL + seed). Add `OPENIDX_APP_PASSWORD` to the postgres env and
  `.env` / `.env.production`.
- **`scripts/seed.sh`** now re-applies `seed.sql` (migrations own the schema + login
  bootstrap) instead of the removed `init-db.sql`.

### Removed

- **`deployments/docker/init-db.sql`** — retired as the schema source. Layering
  migrations on top of it was permanently blocked (v29 `ziti_certificates(identity_id)`
  ordering), and the file was itself broken on current Postgres (`NOW()` in a
  partial-index predicate). Migrate-from-empty is clean to v67 and already seeds a
  working admin install (default org, admin user, `admin-console` client, roles).
- **`TestInitDBParity` / `TestInitDBColumnParity`** (`internal/migrations/initdb_parity_test.go`)
  — no subject once `init-db.sql` is gone; migrations are the sole schema source.

### Upgrade note

The `openidx_app` password hook runs only on **first init of a fresh `postgres_data`
volume**. On an **existing** volume, set the password once:
`ALTER ROLE openidx_app WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '<OPENIDX_APP_PASSWORD>';` (or
`docker compose down -v` / `make dev-clean` to recreate the volume). This is a
compose-only change — systemd/managed deployments are unaffected.

## [1.10.1] - 2026-07-04

Encrypt-secrets-at-rest hardening pass. Secret columns that were previously stored as plaintext
are now AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest, keyed by `ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Rollout is lazy and
flag-day-free: reads are prefix-aware (tagged ciphertext is decrypted; legacy plaintext passes
through untouched), and environments without a usable key fall back to a warned passthrough rather
than crashing.

### Added

- **`internal/common/secretcrypt`** — shared AES-256-GCM helper (#298). `Encrypt` emits
  `encv1:<base64(nonce‖ciphertext)>`; `Decrypt` is prefix-aware (tagged → decrypt, untagged legacy
  plaintext → passthrough); `NewNoop()` provides a best-effort passthrough cipher for environments
  without a 32-byte key (services warn and continue rather than fail closed).

### Changed

- **Webhook signing secrets encrypted at rest** (#299) — `webhook_subscriptions.secret` is now
  encrypted on create and decrypted on read and before HMAC signature computation. Column widened to
  `TEXT` (migration **v65**; file-based `202607030001`).
- **Identity-provider client secrets encrypted at rest** (#300) — `identity_providers.client_secret`
  is encrypted on create/update and decrypted on every read path: identity get/list, the access
  service's multi-IdP route resolution, and the OAuth social-login token exchange. Column widened to
  `TEXT` (migration **v66**; file-based `202607030002`).
- **Guacamole pool tokens encrypted at rest** (#301) — `guacamole_connection_pool.token` is encrypted
  on write. The column is write-only (the in-memory pool serves reads), so there is no decrypt path — a
  database dump cannot yield usable session tokens. Column widened to `TEXT` (migration **v67**).

### Notes

- `oauth_clients.client_secret` was already SHA-256 hashed (constant-time compare, never re-returned)
  and is intentionally out of scope for this pass; the stale `-- TODO: Encrypt` marker was removed.
- Highest migration is now **v67**. `init-db.sql` defines all three columns as `TEXT` directly, so
  fresh installs need no backfill.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-07-03

Readiness-finalization pass across three workstreams: make the shipped PAM usable from the
admin console (W1), close correctness/tenant-isolation gaps (W2), and light production
hardening (W3).

### Added
- **PAM admin console** — the previously backend-only PAM surface is now driveable from the
  console: **Vault Secrets** page (list/create/versions/grants + reason-gated one-shot reveal +
  checkout ledger; #284), **Rotation Policies** page + per-secret rotate-now/history (#285),
  **Privileged Sessions** page (Guacamole pending-request approve/deny, active-session
  monitor/share/force-terminate, transcript download; #286), and a **`vault_credential`** option
  in Access Requests with one-shot retrieve + return-early (#287). A "Privileged Access" nav
  group + dashboard entry point (#289).
- **`GET /api/v1/access/guacamole/session-history`** — admin-guarded, org-scoped listing of
  Guacamole session rows with a `transcript_available` flag (no file paths), so transcripts are
  reachable from the console. (#286)
- **`GET /api/v1/vault/secrets/:id/grants`** — list a secret's access grants (metadata only). (#284)
- **OpenAPI specs** for all shipped PAM endpoints (vault, rotation, Guacamole sessions,
  `vault_credential` retrieve/return) across the admin-api/access/governance specs. (#288)
- **Column-level init-db↔migrations parity guard** (`TestInitDBColumnParity`) — fails CI when an
  `init-db.sql` column is created by no migration (the drift class that breaks migrate-only
  RDS/Helm installs). (#292)

### Changed / Security
- **Attestation tenant isolation** — `attestation_campaigns`/`attestation_items` (created by v54
  without `org_id`) gained `org_id` + the v37 FORCE-RLS belt (USING + WITH CHECK); handlers tag
  `org_id` on write and rely on RLS for reads. Closes a cross-org read/write exposure. Migration
  v61. (#290)
- **`org_id` + FORCE-RLS belt** added to `jit_grants` and `request_approval_chains` (previously
  org-scoped only in-handler). Migration v64. (#293)
- **Access-proxy idle timeout enforced** — routes' `idle_timeout` was dead config on the data
  plane (only absolute expiry was checked). The proxy + forward-auth paths now revoke and re-auth
  a cookie session idle beyond `idle_timeout` (sliding window; bearer tokens unaffected). (#294)
- **Production requires an explicit vault KEK** — `ValidateProduction` now fails unless `VAULT_KEK`
  or `VAULT_KEKS` is set, instead of silently falling back to `ENCRYPTION_KEY` for the vault
  key-encryption key. (#295)

### Fixed
- **Referenced-but-uncreated tables reconciled** — `admin_console_settings`, `auth_contexts`,
  `breach_incidents`, `breach_alerts` were referenced by code but created by neither a migration
  nor `init-db.sql` (latent 500s, the `jit_grants`-class drift). Migration v62 creates them.
  (`access_stats`, also flagged, was a false positive — a CTE, not a table.) (#291)
- **`ziti_certificates` column drift** — the migration schema had diverged wholesale from the
  code/init-db schema (`cert_data NOT NULL`, … vs `cert_type`/`not_after`/`status`/…), breaking
  cert-hardening on migrate-only installs. Reconciled to the code schema; also reconciled 8 other
  tables whose init-db `ALTER … ADD COLUMN` patches were never mirrored into a migration.
  Migration v63. (#292)

### Notes
- **OPA fail-open** was verified to be unreachable in production (the middleware's `devMode` is
  `cfg.IsDevelopment()`, false in prod → fails closed with 403); a regression test now pins the
  invariant. No code change to `opa.go`. (#295)
- **Deferred follow-ups** (tracked; not implemented):
  - **MySQL and cloud-IAM (AWS/GCP/Azure) rotation connectors** behind the M5 `Rotator`
    interface (v1.9.1 shipped SSH + PostgreSQL); **SSH *key* rotation** (v1.9.1 shipped SSH
    *password* rotation).
  - **Guacamole recording legal-hold** — retention works, but `recording_legal_holds` is FK'd to
    `remote_support_sessions` only; covering `guacamole_sessions` recordings needs a shared-hold refactor.
  - **Multi-tenant / production-GA hardening**: docker-compose `openidx_app` (non-owner) cutover +
    FORCE-RLS for compose; prod-compose TLS/Elasticsearch-security/APISIX-admin-key hardening;
    encrypt-at-rest for the legacy plaintext secret columns (`oauth_clients.client_secret`,
    `identity_providers.client_secret`, webhook secrets, guac pool token) via the vault; rotate the
    git-history-compromised APISIX admin key.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-07-02

PAM session assurance (M4) + rotation connectors (M5), plus a recording
data-loss fix.

### Added
- **Session transcripts** — a `guaclog`-based sweep generates a keystroke/command
  transcript for ended/terminated recorded Guacamole sessions and serves it via an
  admin-guarded `GET /api/v1/access/guacamole/sessions/:id/transcript`. Generation is
  `exec.LookPath`-gated (inert if `guaclog` is absent); `guaclog` is included in the
  access-service image. (#279)
- **Live session monitor** — `POST /api/v1/access/guacamole/sessions/:id/share` mints a
  read-only Guacamole connection-sharing link (falls back to the active-session list when
  the server lacks the sharing API). (#279)
- **Session-end detection** — a background sweep reconciles tracked sessions against
  Guacamole's active connections and marks naturally-ended sessions (2-minute grace;
  fail-safe when Guacamole is unreachable). (#279)
- **Attestation of privileged entitlements** — new `vault_access` and `rotation_policy`
  access-certification campaign types; a revoke decision deletes the vault grant / disables
  the rotation policy. (#279)
- **SSH + PostgreSQL rotation connectors** — the rotation engine can now rotate credentials
  on Linux/SSH hosts (`chpasswd` over SSH, host-key-pinned, password via stdin) and
  PostgreSQL (`ALTER ROLE` with server-side identifier/literal quoting). Each resolves its
  bootstrap/admin credential from the vault and verifies by authenticating with the new
  credential; both fail closed. No new dependencies. (#280)

### Fixed
- **Guacamole recording data loss** — `guacamole_sessions.recording_path` stored the shared
  recordings *directory*, so the retention sweep's `RemoveAll` could delete every recording.
  The full recording *file* path is now persisted and purge is guarded so it can never
  remove the recordings root. (#279)

## [1.9.0] - 2026-07-02

Privileged Access Management (PAM) — an integrated credential vault, automated
rotation, just-in-time credential checkout, and privileged-session brokering with
server-side credential injection. Built on the existing vault crypto, approval
workflows, Guacamole brokering, and recording/retention pipeline.

### Added
- **Credential vault** — tenant-isolated, envelope-encrypted secret store
  (per-version HKDF + AES-256-GCM under a rotatable key-encryption keyring that
  defaults to `ENCRYPTION_KEY`; fail-closed). Versioned secrets, per-secret access
  grants, internal server-side `use` vs. reason-gated + audited `reveal`;
  admin-guarded `/api/v1/vault/*` API. Migration v56. (#273)
- **Automated credential rotation** — leader-gated rotation engine with pluggable
  connectors (Active Directory / LDAP / Azure AD via directory write-back;
  generate-only). Candidate-version → apply-to-target → verify → promote, so a
  failed rotation never locks the account out. Scheduled, on-demand (admin), and
  rotate-on-checkout triggers. Migration v57. (#274)
- **Just-in-time credential checkout** — request a vault credential through the
  existing multi-step approval workflow (`resource_type=vault_credential`); on
  approval the requester retrieves the secret once for a bounded window, after
  which access auto-revokes and the credential rotates. (#276)
- **Privileged session brokering with credential injection** — Guacamole
  RDP/SSH/VNC sessions inject the target credential from the vault **server-side**
  (the browser never receives it), with an optional pre-session approval gate,
  admin force-terminate (with reason), and native session recording retained via
  the existing recording-retention policy. Migration v59. (#277)

### Fixed
- Created `jit_grants` and `request_approval_chains` — referenced by governance
  code but never created by any migration, so JIT elevation, the escalation
  worker, and `POST /api/v1/governance/requests` were returning 500s. Migration
  v58. (#275)

### Notes
- Each service that uses the vault (admin-api, governance, access) reads the shared
  `ENCRYPTION_KEY` / `VAULT_KEK` and instantiates an in-process vault; the access
  service additionally needs a shared recording volume for Guacamole recordings.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- **Optional device-trust enforcement for clientless (BrowZer) access.** With
  `OPENIDX_REQUIRE_DEVICE_TRUST_FOR_CLIENTLESS=true` (off by default), an OIDC
  login for the clientless (BrowZer) client from an untrusted device is refused —
  the login page shows "This device must be approved before clientless access" and
  a device-trust request is filed for admin approval (admin console → **Device
  Trust Approval**); after approval, the retry succeeds. Closes the gap where a
  BrowZer route's `require_device_trust` was silently unenforced (BrowZer traffic
  bypasses the proxy's HTTP forward-auth). Enforced at the OIDC login
  (`handleAuthorizeCallback` — BrowZer's server-rendered login — and
  `handleLogin`); per-device, not per-route. (#268, #269, #270)

## [1.8.1] - 2026-07-01

Security & production-readiness hardening — remediation of the v2.0 GA
production-readiness audit (all P0s + four P1s + a P2 cluster).

### Security
- Access proxy now verifies a bearer JWT's signature + expiry (RS256 via the
  OAuth JWKS) before building a session; forged/unsigned tokens are rejected
  (P0-1, #255).
- Pre-tenant-resolution lookups against RLS-forced tables (API-key validation,
  proxy route/session/device/posture reads, Ziti startup, audit webhook
  bookkeeping) are bypass-wrapped so they no longer fail closed under the
  non-owner `openidx_app` role; WebAuthn login is org-scoped (P0-2, #254).
- OAuth token introspection now honors revocation — a revoked token reports
  `active:false` (#259).
- Removed the hardcoded APISIX admin key from the repo; templated from env
  (P0-4, #256). **Rotate the previously-committed key wherever deployed.**
- Enabled branch protection on `main` (Required Checks, enforce_admins) (P0-5).
- Production config validation now checks the *effective* DB sslmode (parsed from
  `DATABASE_URL`, not just the standalone field) (#263).
- Bumped auth/transport-critical dependencies (x/crypto, x/net, pgx/v5,
  go-webauthn, go-redis/v9); transitive advisories dropped 23→2 (#264).
- Platform-admin cross-org audit now records under RLS and logs failures;
  IP-threat DB errors are surfaced; dead runtime-DDL removed (P2, #265).

### Fixed
- 58 tables that existed only in `init-db.sql` are now created by migration
  **v54**, so managed-Postgres/RDS/Helm/`migrate` installs stop 500ing across
  MFA/SAML/social/lifecycle/ISPM/audit features; a parity test guards against
  recurrence (P0-3, #257).
- Split the deprovisioning policy-run log into `lifecycle_policy_executions`
  (migration **v55**) — it collided with the workflow `lifecycle_executions`
  schema, breaking deprovisioning execution records on every install (#258).
- Docs workflow no longer passes `latest latest` to `mike deploy` (#261).

### Changed
- Migrated off go-redis deprecated APIs (`SetEx`→`Set`, `GetSet`→`SetArgs`,
  `ZRevRange`→`ZRangeArgs`) (#264).
- `.gitignore` now excludes `*.zip` to prevent stray archive exports being
  committed (#266).

## [1.8.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- **Database-enforced tenant isolation (RLS activation)** — the v1.8 milestone of
  the multi-tenancy epic. The app now connects as a dedicated non-owner
  `openidx_app` role (`NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS`), so the `FORCE`'d row-level
  security policies (the predicate + FORCE shipped earlier in v37) finally
  enforce instead of being bypassed by a superuser connection. A no-GUC query on
  a scoped table now returns 0 rows; queries see only the request's org via the
  `app.org_id` GUC set at pool checkout; platform/cross-org paths opt in via
  `app.bypass_rls`. This is defense-in-depth *behind* the v1.7 app-layer `org_id`
  filtering. (#250)

### Changed
- **Migration v53** provisions `openidx_app` with blanket DML grants + default
  privileges (passwordless; the password is set out-of-band at deploy). Migrations
  and DDL continue to run as the owner role; services keep `AUTO_MIGRATE` off and
  the app `DATABASE_URL` points at `openidx_app`. `init-db.sql` provisions the
  same role for fresh installs. (#250)

## [1.7.2] - 2026-06-29

### Security
- **`github.com/jackc/pgx/v5` v5.5.4 → v5.9.2** — resolves GO-2026-5004.
  `govulncheck` now reports 0 affected vulnerabilities. (#248)

### Fixed
- **CI hard gates restored to green** (`Required Checks`). The org-scope, lint,
  and vulnerability gates had regressed:
  - **orgscope**: annotated the 19 org-unscoped queries the governance/devices
    work introduced (the Relations & Integrity Doctor's whole-install scans and
    queries keyed by globally-unique ids) with reviewed `//orgscope:ignore`
    directives. (#247)
  - **lint**: removed an unused var + orphaned import in `ziti_settings.go`;
    justified the deprecated, operator-supplied `google.CredentialsFromJSON` call
    in `play_integrity.go`; migrated the RLS pool hook `BeforeAcquire →
    PrepareConn` (deprecated by the pgx bump), preserving exact checkout
    semantics. (#247, #248)

## [1.7.1] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed
- **A fresh `apisix-edge` install can now stand up the full eight-service stack
  from a clean checkout.** The `gateway` service (`:8008`) is tracked as a
  systemd unit and added to the install's `enable --now` list (it had been
  running as an unmanaged `/tmp` process); the runbook now builds the service
  binaries into `~/oidx-runtime/bin` (the units' `ExecStart` targets); and the
  access-service launch wrapper ships as a sanitized `run-access.sh.example`
  (previously untracked, so a fresh install left the access-proxy with no start
  script). (#243, #244, #245)

## [1.7.0] - 2026-06-26

### Governance & devices: policies that enforce + real device trust (#234–#239)

Made the governance and devices domains actually work end-to-end. The policy
engine was a permissive no-op and device-trust signals were never populated, so
Zero-Trust controls silently passed everything; the device-trust approval
workflow existed but had no entry point; and a redundant policy engine sat
unwired. After this work: governance policies evaluate and enforce, device
posture and per-device trust flow into every access decision (forward-auth and
continuous re-verification), untrusted devices on trust-required routes file
approval requests that flip trust on approval, and the dead engine is gone.

#### Added
- **Device posture bridge** (D1): agent posture reports are written to
  `device_posture_results` so the access context evaluator enforces posture for
  the reporting device; migration v50 adds the upsert key. (#234)
- **Service-to-service auth for policy evaluation** (G1): a shared
  `INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN`; the access-proxy presents it as `X-Internal-Token`
  (constant-time, scoped to governance `/evaluate`) so the policy call is
  authenticated instead of 401-failing-closed. (#235)
- **Device-trust request auto-creation** (D3): when an untrusted device hits a
  `require_device_trust` route, the proxy files a deduped pending
  `device_trust_requests` row — the missing entry point that feeds the existing
  approval queue. Approve/reject now notify the user, and new requests notify
  org admins, via the notifications service. (#238)
- **Migration v52**: reconcile the continuous-verify columns that existed only in
  `init-db.sql` (`proxy_sessions.{last_verified_at,verification_failures,geo_*,
  idp_id,device_trusted}`, `user_sessions.device_trusted`) onto migrate-based
  installs. (#239)

#### Changed
- **The governance policy engine actually enforces** (G1): `GetPolicy` /
  `ListPolicies` now load `policy_rules` (via a shared `loadPolicyRules`), so the
  per-type evaluators (separation-of-duty, risk, timebound, location,
  conditional-access) and the step-up loop run against real rules instead of an
  empty set. (#235)
- **`ProxySession.DeviceTrusted` is populated** from `known_devices.trusted`,
  matched by the request's device fingerprint (D2) — feeding the context checks,
  the inline policy DSL, and the governance `/evaluate` call. The continuous
  verifier re-derives it live each pass rather than reading a stale column.
  (#237, #239)

#### Fixed
- **Policy rule loading queried non-existent columns** (`condition/effect/
  priority` vs the real `rule_type/conditions/actions`); the error was swallowed,
  so rules silently never loaded — the true root cause behind "policies don't
  enforce." (#235)
- **The continuous session verifier errored every run** on migrate-based installs
  — its driver query referenced `proxy_sessions` columns present only in
  `init-db.sql`. (#239)

#### Removed
- **The dead `ZTPolicy` subsystem** (handler, store, model, tests; ~4,900 LOC)
  — never wired into any service, no table, no UI, its general-ABAC niche already
  served by the live `abac-policies` surface. Migration v51 drops the (never
  created) `zt_policies` / `zt_policy_versions` tables as a belt. (#236)

### Relations & Integrity Doctor — cross-domain health + referential integrity (#230, #231, #233)

A self-service "doctor" that scans the relationships *between* domains — proxy
routes, Applications tiles, OAuth clients, Ziti services, published apps,
identities — surfaces broken or orphaned wiring, and heals the safe cases
automatically; plus DB-level referential integrity so the most common orphans
can't form in the first place.

#### Added
- **Relations & Integrity Doctor** (`internal/access/health_engine.go`,
  `health_checks.go`): a check registry that scans cross-domain relations
  (route↔tile, app↔client, route↔Ziti, host uniqueness, published-app,
  identity↔Ziti, BrowZer-config dedup, domain presence, …), returns a structured
  report, auto-heals findings classified Safe, and leaves risky ones for an
  explicit fix. Exposed at `GET /api/v1/access/health/relations[?heal=safe]` and
  `POST /api/v1/access/health/fix/:checkId`, with a `HealRoute` after-mutation
  hook so a route change re-checks its own wiring. (#230)
- **Referential integrity** (migration v49): `applications.route_id →
  proxy_routes` and `applications.oauth_client_id → oauth_clients`, both
  `ON DELETE CASCADE`, backfilled from the existing id conventions — so deleting
  a route or client can no longer strand an Applications tile/app. (#231)

#### Changed
- Doctor check polish from review follow-ups: tightened classifications and
  counts (e.g. domain-presence counts `known_devices`, not a non-existent table).
  (#233)

### App, OAuth & clientless-publishing fixes (#223–#229, #232)

A run of fixes making OAuth client registration, the Applications view, and
clientless app publishing mutually consistent — registered clients are visible
and editable, and a published app maps cleanly to one host / one Ziti service.

#### Added
- **Applications tiles auto-sync for proxy routes**: creating/registering a
  client or proxy route surfaces a launcher tile without a manual step.
  (#224, #225)
- **App redirect_uris auto-register on the BrowZer OIDC client**, so a freshly
  published clientless app doesn't 400 on its first OAuth redirect. (#227)
- **One-app-per-host publishing**: an app publishes as a single host route → one
  Ziti service → one BrowZer target → one APISIX route, instead of exploding into
  one route per discovered path (which collided on the per-host BrowZer naming);
  discovered paths stay as advisory metadata. (#229)

#### Fixed
- **OAuth client registration 500** — new clients weren't assigned a UUID. (#223)
- **Registered clients didn't appear** in the Applications list. (#224)
- **Editing an application** now syncs its backing OAuth client (name/redirects),
  instead of drifting from it. (#226)
- **BrowZer config generators use the *effective* hosting mode** (fixing overlay
  error `1010` when a route's stored mode disagreed with its resolved mode).
  (#228)
- **`ziti_browzer_config` is a singleton** — the bootstrap reseed no longer
  appends a new row on every startup. (#232)

### Clientless edge on APISIX + console-managed publishing (#211–#221)

Moved the public `:443` edge from nginx to **Apache APISIX** as the single TLS
terminator, with the access-service pushing per-app BrowZer routes to it
dynamically; and hardened publishing so a clientless app can be created,
**edited, renamed, and deleted entirely from the admin console** without leaving
orphaned overlay/edge state. Resolves a class of failures hit while publishing
external HTTPS apps (`secops`, `es-dev`): BrowZer `1003`, OAuth/SAML 403s, and
stranded wiring after a rename/delete.

#### Added
- **APISIX edge** (`deployments/apisix-edge/`): a dedicated APISIX instance as
  the sole `:443` edge (TLS via the `*.tdv.org` wildcard), with `seed-edge-routes.sh`
  for the static routes (API fan-out, `/oauth`, `/scim`, `*.tdv.org` access-proxy)
  and systemd user units for the access + backend services. nginx is reduced to
  the admin-console SPA upstream. (#211, #213)
- **APISIX route reconciler** (`internal/access/apisix_reconciler.go`): the
  access-service pushes/prunes the per-app `browzer-<app>` edge routes from
  `proxy_routes` via the Admin API (gated by `APISIX_EDGE_ENABLED`). (#211)
- **Hosting-mode picker** in the proxy-route create/edit form — **Auto
  (recommended) / Hop — external·HTTPS / Direct — local·dark** — wired through the
  proxy-route CRUD (`hosting_mode`). (#220)
- **Edge routes for the oauth-service's management APIs**: `/api/v1/oauth/*` and
  `/api/v1/saml/*` now route to `:8006` (were missing, so they fell to the
  `/api/*` admin catch-all and 404'd). (#218, #219)
- **Router WSS config artifacts** (`deployments/apisix-edge/ziti-router/`): the
  edge router serves the clientless BrowZer overlay on `wss:3023` presenting the
  browser-trusted `*.tdv.org` cert via `transport.wss.identity`. (#214, #215)
- Docs: clientless edge architecture (`docs/OPENIDX_CLIENTLESS_EDGE_ARCHITECTURE.md`)
  and a publish-a-service guide with the full certificate matrix
  (`docs/PUBLISHING_A_SERVICE.md`). (#212, #217)

#### Changed
- **BrowZer routes auto-select their hosting mode** from the upstream:
  `EffectiveMode` promotes a BrowZer route off `identity` (never valid for the
  `#browzer-users` dial) and picks **hop** for external HTTPS / Host-routed
  upstreams, **direct** for local/HTTP — explicit hop/direct still honored. (#220)
- **OAuth client management and SAML SP management are now always authenticated**,
  not just outside `development` — the management groups get the auth middleware
  unconditionally while the interactive OIDC flow endpoints keep their env-gated
  behavior. (#218, #219)
- The external-IdP **OIDC `form_post` bypass is OFF by default**
  (`BROWZER_OIDC_CALLBACK_PATHS=""`): once the WSS overlay is healthy the service
  worker tunnels the callback, so a direct bypass splits the cookie context and
  loops the app back to login. (#216)

#### Fixed
- **BrowZer `1003` (service not dialable by the overlay)**: the reconciler now
  **converges** Bind/Dial service policies (upsert by name) instead of
  create-if-exists, so a route that transitions identity→router-hosted (e.g.
  BrowZer enabled after OpenZiti) has its stale `#access-proxy-clients` policies
  corrected to `#ziti-routers` / `#browzer-users`. (#220)
- **OAuth/SAML management 403/404 through the edge**: routing gap (mis-routed to
  admin-api) + dev-mode no-auth on the oauth-service. (#218, #219)
- **Route delete and rename left orphans**: deleting a route now tears down its
  Ziti service + policies + `host.v1` config + service-edge-router policy, and
  prunes the APISIX route + bootstrapper target; renaming re-keys the edge wiring
  to the new host instead of stranding it under the old one. (#221)
- **BrowZer `1007` (no WSS routers) / `1016` (WSS cert)** on the clientless path,
  and the **psm Entra login loop** caused by the direct OIDC bypass. (#214, #215, #216)

### Per-app BrowZer publishing via the OpenZiti reconciler (#201–#208)

Publish multiple apps clientlessly behind BrowZer — each as its own dark Ziti
service — and toggle them from the admin console without breaking the overlay.
Motivated by publishing a second BrowZer app (`psm.tdv.org`, an external HTTPS
IIS/.NET upstream) alongside `netgraph`: the BrowZer WASM runtime sends a fixed
`Host: unknown` and **no SNI** on every overlay request, so the old shared
`browzer-router` (which demuxed apps by Host) could only ever serve one app.

#### Added
- **OpenZiti reconciler** (`internal/access/ziti_reconciler.go`, gated by
  `ZITI_RECONCILER`): declaratively converges the controller to the desired
  state read from `proxy_routes` — per-app services, bind/dial/service-edge-router
  policies, `host.v1` configs, and router/SDK hosting — on boot, a 30s tick, and
  on demand. Replaces the imperative provisioning path as the single owner of all
  Ziti mutations. (#201)
- **Per-app BrowZer services**: each clientless app gets its own Ziti service
  hosted by the edge **router** via a fixed `host.v1` config (`{protocol,address,
  port}`), so there is no Host demux — removing the single-app limit of the shared
  router. (#201)
- **`hosting_mode = 'hop'`** for Host-routed / HTTPS upstreams (e.g. IIS/.NET):
  a per-app plain-HTTP hop (nginx) that listens on a deterministic `base+index`
  port, rewrites the `Host` header, and proxies to the real upstream; emits a
  per-route landing-path 302 so the post-OIDC `/` lands on the app's entry path.
  (#202, #203)
- **Public per-app nginx vhost generator** (`internal/access/browzer_vhosts.go`,
  `BROWZER_VHOST_CONFIG_PATH`): the access-service renders one TLS `server {}` per
  `ziti+browzer`-enabled route (`server_name <app>.tdv.org` → bootstrapper
  `:8445`), so publishing a clientless app needs **no** front-nginx hand-edit.
  Hop-mode routes additionally get an external-IdP **OIDC `form_post` callback
  bypass** (`location ~ /(signin-oidc|signout-callback-oidc)$` → the route's hop
  port). Config: `BROWZER_BOOTSTRAPPER_ADDR`, `BROWZER_VHOST_SSL_CERT/KEY`,
  `BROWZER_OIDC_CALLBACK_PATHS`. A poll-reload entrypoint
  (`deployments/docker/oidx-nginx-entrypoint.sh`, wildcard-`include`d from
  `nginx.conf`) reloads the front nginx when the generated file changes. (#208)

#### Changed
- **The admin-console one-click feature toggle defers to the reconciler** when
  `ZITI_RECONCILER` is on: enable/disable only write the `proxy_routes` flags
  (`ziti_enabled` / `browzer_enabled` / `ziti_service_name`) and enqueue a
  converge — no imperative service/policy creation or SDK hosting. Imperative
  behavior is unchanged when the reconciler is off. (#206)
- `RegenerateConfigs` (the toggle path) now also rewrites the hop and public
  vhost configs, not just the bootstrapper targets and router config — so a
  newly-toggled app gets its hop/public block live without a restart. (#208)

#### Fixed
- **`psm.tdv.org` 502 + feature-manager↔reconciler conflict**: with the
  reconciler on, the UI toggle still provisioned imperatively (SDK-hosting the
  service with an `edge` terminator and `#access-proxy-clients` policies, and
  renaming `ziti_service_name`), colliding with the reconciler's router-hosted
  `tunnel` terminator — the access-proxy then forwarded plain HTTP to the app's
  `:443`. Fixed by attaching the `host.v1` config to existing services
  (`EnsureServiceConfig`, #205) and by making the toggle defer (#206).
- **BrowZer hop leaked `unknown:<port>` on server redirects**: the hop set the
  upstream `Host`, so the app emitted a correct absolute `Location`, but nginx's
  **default `proxy_redirect`** rewrote it back to the proxy's own address — and
  since the runtime's `Host` is `unknown`, that became
  `http://unknown:<port>/…` (the psm Entra-login 302). Generated hop blocks now
  emit `proxy_redirect off;`. (#207)
- **Reconciler self-heals drifted `host.v1` configs** (create-or-PATCH on data
  drift) so per-app hop-port reshuffles converge automatically with no manual
  `ziti edge delete config`. (#204)

### Dark (loopback-bound) services behind BrowZer + native client (#196)

Publish a service that is **completely dark to the outside** — bound to host
loopback, reachable only over the OpenZiti overlay — while still serving it
clientlessly via BrowZer and/or a native client.

#### Added
- **`BROWZER_HOST_LOOPBACK_ALIAS`** (env, `browzer_targets.go` `browzerUpstream()`).
  In rootless deployments the native access-proxy (a host process) reaches a dark
  target at `127.0.0.1`, but the BrowZer router (a separate network namespace,
  e.g. slirp4netns) cannot. Since both upstreams derive from one route `to_url`,
  this knob rewrites a `127.0.0.1`/`localhost` `to_url` to the alias (e.g.
  `10.0.2.2` with `allow_host_loopback`) **for the BrowZer router config only**.
  Unset (the default, e.g. docker-compose where router and app share a bridge) →
  no rewrite, behavior unchanged.
- Admin console **Identities**: a **Download `.jwt`** button on the enrollment
  modal, so a one-time enrollment token can be fed straight to
  `ziti-edge-tunnel enroll --jwt` / Ziti Desktop Edge for native (no-browser)
  access to dark services.
- `docs/OPENIDX_ZITI_ARCHITECTURE.md`: full OpenIDX + OpenZiti architecture
  guide, including a "dark services + native client" recipe (and the rootless
  loopback-alias wrinkle).

### One-click OpenZiti/BrowZer toggles on proxy routes (#195)

#### Added
- `RouteFeatureToggles` — compact **OpenZiti** and **BrowZer** switches rendered
  directly in each HTTP proxy route's action bar on the Proxy Routes page, so
  putting a route behind the overlay (and publishing it clientlessly via BrowZer)
  is a single click. BrowZer is gated on OpenZiti, matching `ServiceFeaturePanel`.
  Reuses the existing `/services/:id/features/{ziti,browzer}/{enable,disable}`
  endpoints (no backend change) and shares the `['service-status', routeId]`
  query cache with the expand panel so both stay in sync.

### Admin console bug fixes (found via Playwright page sweep)

A headless logged-in sweep of all ~83 console pages surfaced four real bugs:

#### Fixed
- **Governance endpoints returned 401 for every valid token** — governance's
  JWKS key parser ran `ProbablyPrime()` on the RSA *modulus*, which is `p×q`
  (composite by definition), so it rejected every key. All governance pages
  (access-reviews/requests, policies, abac-policies, approval-policies,
  campaigns) were unusable. Replaced with the correct odd-modulus check.
- **`GET /users/me/consents` 500** — the query selected `rt.scope` without
  including it in `GROUP BY` (SQLSTATE 42803). Now aggregates with
  `string_agg(DISTINCT rt.scope, ' ')`.
- **Migration v39** — creates `device_trust_requests`, `device_trust_settings`,
  `trusted_browsers`, `risk_policies`, which existed only in `init-db.sql` (the
  same gap class as v38), so their handlers 500'd on RDS/Helm/`migrate` deploys.
  Also made `GetDeviceTrustSettings` return defaults on no-rows instead of 500.
  *(A wider audit found ~70 more tables only in `init-db.sql`; closing that whole
  gap — and reconciling init-db.sql's own duplicate `lifecycle_executions` — is
  tracked as follow-up.)*
- **`/users` client crash** — avatar initials read `user.username[0]` without a
  null guard (`Cannot read properties of undefined`). Now uses optional chaining
  with a `'?'` fallback.
- **`/users` showed blank names/emails + "Invalid Date"** — the admin users API
  speaks SCIM (`userName`, `name.givenName`, `emails[].value`, `createdAt`,
  `active`) per the identity models + SCIM integration tests, but the console is
  flat snake_case throughout. The console now adapts SCIM↔flat for the users
  endpoint (read and create/update) in `users.tsx`, leaving the rest of the page
  flat. (Backend left unchanged — its SCIM shape is the codified contract used by
  `/scim/v2/Users` and internal oauth/webauthn callers.)
- **`/groups` showed blank descriptions, wrong type, "Invalid Date"** — same
  SCIM↔flat mismatch (`displayName`, `attributes.{description,parentId}`,
  `createdAt`). `groups.tsx` now adapts read and create/update. (Member counts
  show 0 — the list endpoint doesn't return them; an API enhancement, not a
  console fix.)
- **Other SCIM-shaped consumers** (found by auditing every console call to the
  identity user/group endpoints): the group "add member" user-search dropdown
  (`/users/search`, SCIM) and the bulk-operations group selector
  (`/groups`, a bare SCIM array — the code expected `{data:[{id,name}]}`) now
  map SCIM→flat too. Audited as already-correct: group members, user roles,
  roles, and `/users/me` (camelCase, which `user-profile` already matches).

### One-click "open internal app" — published apps as launcher tiles

#### Added
- `POST /api/v1/access/apps/:id/publish-app` publishes a registered app as a
  one-click tile: it creates a single host-level proxy route, auto-creates a
  **My Apps** launcher tile (`applications` row, `base_url` = the gated public
  URL), and registers the per-host `…/access/.auth/callback` on the
  `access-proxy` OAuth client so SSO round-trips without a manual OAuth edit.
- `ACCESS_APPS_DOMAIN` config: bare-label hosts (e.g. `netgraph`) resolve to
  `<label>.<ACCESS_APPS_DOMAIN>` so every app lives under one wildcard domain
  with a single wildcard TLS cert.
- Migration **v41**: `published_apps.public_host` + `landing_path` (where the
  tile opens, default `/`, e.g. `/ui/` for apps not served at the site root).
- Admin console **App Publish → Publish App** dialog (public host + landing
  path). Docs: `docs/app-publishing.md` "One-Click Publishing" section.

### Access-proxy forward-auth: honor X-Forwarded-Proto

#### Fixed
- The access-service built its OAuth callback (`/access/.auth/callback`) as
  `http://` from `c.Request.Host`, ignoring `X-Forwarded-Proto`. Behind a
  TLS-terminating proxy (nginx/APISIX) the public URL is HTTPS, so the emitted
  `redirect_uri` didn't match the registered/public `https://` URL and the
  browser callback hit a non-TLS port. Added a `callbackScheme()` helper
  (X-Forwarded-Proto → request TLS → http) and applied it to all four callback
  builders (the built-in access-proxy login/exchange + the external-IDP paths).

### Access-proxy / App Publish schema fix (migration v40)

#### Fixed
- **App Publish was broken on every migrate-based / RDS / Helm deploy.**
  `GET /api/v1/access/apps` 500'd because `published_apps`, `discovered_paths`
  and `service_features` lived only in `init-db.sql`; `GET /api/v1/access/routes`
  500'd with `column "idp_id" does not exist` because the `proxy_routes` (and
  `proxy_sessions`) schema had drifted ~12 columns behind `init-db.sql`
  (`idp_id`, `route_type`, `remote_host/port`, posture/risk/guacamole/browzer …).
  Migration **v40** creates the missing tables and adds the missing columns
  (idempotent). Verified by registering→discovering→publishing an internal app
  end-to-end.

### gateway-service startup fixes

`gateway-service` panicked on startup under gin v1.11.0 and never began serving
(installs fronting it with APISIX wouldn't have noticed). Three stacked bugs,
each masked by the previous panic:

#### Fixed
- **Route catch-all conflict**: each service's route file registered ~dozens of
  explicit routes *plus* a `/*path` catch-all with the identical proxy handler;
  gin v1.11.0 rejects a catch-all alongside explicit siblings (`/users`).
  Collapsed each service to the single catch-all — behaviourally identical (one
  handler, no per-route middleware) and the correct shape for a pass-through.
- **Duplicate `/health` registration**: the gateway `Service`, the standardized
  `newhealth` service, and the routes package each registered `/health` (and
  `/ready`) on the same engine → `handlers are already registered for path
  '/health'`. The gateway now uses the `Service`'s health routes only (which is
  what the k8s probes and compose healthcheck hit at `/health`).
- **Wrong proxy targets**: `serviceURLProvider` hardcoded `localhost:8501–8506`
  (ignoring env), so the gateway proxied to non-existent/incorrect ports. Fixed
  the defaults to the services' real ports (`8001/8002/8004/8005/8006`) and added
  `<SERVICE>_SERVICE_URL` env overrides (e.g. `IDENTITY_SERVICE_URL`).

### CI green-up + GetUser NULL-name fix

#### Fixed
- **`GetUser` 404'd on users with no name**: `users.first_name`/`last_name` are
  nullable, but the read scanned them into non-pointer strings, so any name-less
  user (valid per SCIM) errored the scan and surfaced as 404. The read now
  `COALESCE`s both to `''`.
- **CI Lint**: removed an ineffectual `countArgCount++` in `internal/admin/service.go`.
- **CI Integration job**: set `DEFAULT_ORG_FALLBACK=true` for the suite. It is
  single-org (most tests log in the seeded admin without an `X-Org-Slug`/subdomain
  signal); the config default flipped to `false` in v1.7.0, which had been failing
  every admin-token-dependent test. The cross-org test still sends `X-Org-Slug`
  explicitly, so isolation is still validated.

### Tenant login branding + production hardening (v1.9.0)

Per-tenant branding on both login surfaces, plus production-readiness fixes —
three of which were surfaced by a prod-like local docker-compose smoke and would
otherwise only have failed in a real multi-tenant deploy.

#### Added
- **OAuth server-rendered login page branding** (`internal/oauth/service.go`):
  `renderLoginPage` now applies the resolved tenant's `tenant_branding` (logo,
  favicon, colors, titles, custom CSS, footer, powered-by toggle) with safe
  defaults on no-org/no-row; text/attrs escaped, `custom_css` treated as trusted
  admin input. Unit test `internal/oauth/branding_test.go`.
- **SPA login branding** (`web/admin-console/src/pages/login.tsx`): applies
  favicon, secondary color, page background (color/image), injected `custom_css`,
  custom footer, and powered-by visibility — on top of the existing
  logo/primary/title/message handling.
- **Migration v38**: creates `tenant_branding`, `tenant_domains` and
  `tenant_settings` in the versioned migration set. They previously existed only
  in `deployments/docker/init-db.sql` (docker-compose), so managed-RDS/Helm
  deploys never had them — branding could not be saved and domain-based tenant
  resolution silently returned defaults. DDL is idempotent.
- **`DATABASE_SSL_MODE` plumbed through deploy configs**: parametrized in
  docker-compose (`${DATABASE_SSL_MODE:-disable}`), the Helm DB-URL secret
  (`database.sslMode`), and documented in `.env.example`. (The Go config/pool
  side already honored it.)
- **`values-prod.yaml` + runbook**: production tenancy env (`TENANT_BASE_DOMAIN`,
  `DEFAULT_ORG_FALLBACK=false`), `database.sslMode: require`, and the tenancy/RLS
  sections + multi-tenancy post-deploy smoke in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.

#### Fixed
- **Public login-branding endpoint blocked in multi-tenant deploys**: the
  fail-closed `TenantResolver` rejected `GET /api/v1/identity/branding` when
  `DEFAULT_ORG_FALLBACK=false`, so the login page could never load tenant
  branding. The endpoint (which self-resolves the tenant from `?org=`/`?domain=`)
  is now exempt from tenant resolution.
- **`TestRLSBelt` was inert under a superuser DB role**: PostgreSQL superusers
  (and `BYPASSRLS` roles) ignore RLS even with FORCE, so the belt test passed
  vacuously against the default `openidx` superuser used by the postgres image
  and CI. It now runs its assertions as a dedicated `NOSUPERUSER` role —
  mirroring how production connects to RDS — making the CI gate meaningful.
  Documented the non-superuser connection requirement in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.

#### Tenancy env injection (Helm)
- The `-config` ConfigMap now carries `TENANT_BASE_DOMAIN`, `DEFAULT_ORG_FALLBACK`,
  `DEFAULT_ORG_ID` and `DATABASE_SSL_MODE`, and every backend deployment mounts it
  via `envFrom` so the settings actually reach the pods.

### Multi-tenancy — RLS belt + per-org primitives (v1.8.0)

Defense-in-depth: Postgres Row-Level Security so a missing app-layer org filter
still cannot leak across tenants, plus the per-org primitives.

#### Added
- Migration **v37**: activates RLS on all 68 org-scoped tables — policies
  rewritten to `app.bypass_rls='on' OR org_id = current_setting('app.org_id')`
  with `ENABLE` + `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` (fail-closed when the GUC is unset).
- Pool-checkout GUC injection (`internal/common/database/rls.go`): each
  connection is stamped with the request's tenant scope from `orgctx`; no query
  call-site changes. `orgctx.WithBypassRLS` is the explicit opt-in for
  background/cross-org jobs (wired into ~25 ticker/sweep entrypoints + the migrator).
- Two-tenant RLS ship-gate test (`test/integration/cross_org_test.go:TestRLSBelt`):
  a raw cross-org `SELECT` returns 0 rows even with the app filter "broken".
- Per-org rate-limit buckets; `compliance_reader` org-scoped read-only audit role;
  admin-console **Branding** page; `docs/multitenancy-upgrade-runbook.md`.

#### Changed
- **BREAKING (operational):** with RLS forced, direct SQL against org-scoped
  tables sees no rows unless the session sets `app.org_id` (or
  `app.bypass_rls='on'`). See the upgrade runbook.

### Multi-tenancy — App-layer enforcement (v1.7.0)

The v2.0 multi-tenancy epic's enforcement milestone. Every service query now
reads `org_id` from request context and filters/populates by it
(`orgscope ./internal` = 0), and tenant isolation is **activated**.

#### Added
- Cross-org integration test (`test/integration/cross_org_test.go`): a token
  scoped to org A gets **404** (not 403) reading org B's data; a platform admin
  (`super_admin`) may read cross-org via `X-Org-ID` and every such access writes
  an `audit_events` row (`platform_admin_cross_org_access`).
- Platform-admin bypass + mandatory audit, wired through the `TenantResolver`
  (`OnPlatformCrossOrg` hook + `auth.SuperAdminPredicate`).
- Per-tenant JWT `iss` and per-tenant OIDC discovery, derived from the org slug
  and `TENANT_BASE_DOMAIN`.
- Admin-console tenant selector (super_admin-only) that scopes requests via
  `X-Org-Slug`.
- `orgscope` is now a hard CI gate (`-fail`).

#### Changed
- **BREAKING (config):** `DEFAULT_ORG_FALLBACK` now defaults to **false** — a
  request that resolves no tenant is rejected (400) instead of being scoped to
  the default org. Single-tenant installs must set `DEFAULT_ORG_FALLBACK=true`.
- JWT `iss` is per-tenant when `TENANT_BASE_DOMAIN` is set (token-format change;
  global issuer otherwise, so single-tenant installs are unaffected).

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-11

**Multi-tenancy Foundation milestone.** First of four releases in
the v2.0 multi-tenant SaaS isolation epic (`docs/v2-multitenancy-
design.md`). v1.6.0 lays the schema + plumbing groundwork **without
changing any behavior** for existing single-tenant installs — the
ship gate for this milestone is "existing functionality unchanged."

Multi-tenancy enforcement comes in v1.7.0 (service-layer query
scoping) and v1.8.0 (RLS belt + per-org primitives). v1.6.0 is the
foundation other releases build on.

### Added

- **`internal/common/orgctx` package** (#136). Pure-additive
  `context.Context` carrier for the resolved organization (UUID id
  + slug) and a platform-admin marker. The tenant-resolution
  middleware writes into it; v1.7.0 service code reads from it.
  `With` / `From` / `MustFrom` / `WithPlatformAdmin` /
  `IsPlatformAdmin` exposed with `ErrNoOrgContext` sentinel. 10
  unit tests.

- **`internal/common/middleware.TenantResolver`** (#140). The gin
  middleware that resolves the request's organization from
  `X-Org-Slug` header (gateway-set from subdomain), JWT `org_id`
  claim already attached by the Auth middleware, or `X-Org-ID`
  header (platform-admin only). Falls back to the install's
  default org so single-tenant installs keep working unchanged.
  Defines the `OrgLookup` interface and `ErrOrgNotFound`
  sentinel. 16 unit tests covering every resolution path.

- **`tools/orgscope` CLI** (#141). Static helper that walks
  `internal/` looking for SQL statements targeting a scoped
  table without an `org_id` reference. Filters out gin's
  `c.Query("client_id")`-style false positives by checking that
  the string literal starts with a SQL keyword. Mirrors v36's
  scoped-table list (68 tables, with documented install-wide
  exclusions). Wired into Go CI as an **informational job**
  ("Org-scope lint") that posts findings to the run summary but
  never gates a PR — v1.7.0 will promote to `-fail` once the
  service-layer refactors complete. Baseline on current `main`:
  ~1096 findings, each a concrete v1.7.0 refactor target. 28
  unit + fixture tests.

- **`docs/v2-multitenancy-design.md`** (#135). The architectural
  design doc the v1.0 plan called out as a v2 prerequisite.
  Captures three approved decisions (tenant resolution model,
  app-layer + Postgres RLS defense-in-depth, automatic `'default'`
  org backfill for existing installs), the four-milestone delivery
  plan (v1.6 → v2.0), out-of-scope items, risk register, sizing.

### Changed (schema)

- **Migration v34** (#137) — `org_id UUID NULL` column +
  `idx_<table>_org_id` index added to ~55 tables that migration
  v25 didn't reach (api_keys, mfa_*, oauth_*_tokens, ziti_*,
  scim_*, directory_*, privacy_*, posture_*, governance tables,
  …). Idempotent via `IF NOT EXISTS`. Six tables explicitly **not**
  scoped because they are install-wide rather than tenant-data:
  `organizations`, `permissions`, `system_settings`,
  `ip_threat_list`, `posture_check_types`, `policy_sync_state`.

- **Migration v35** (#138) — Backfills the default organization
  UUID (`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000010`, created by v25)
  into every NULL `org_id` row across v34's scoped set. Idempotent
  via `WHERE org_id IS NULL` guards. Down is narrower: only
  reverses rows currently holding the default UUID, so multi-org
  installs (none today) stay intact.

- **Migration v36** (#139) — Final foundation migration. For each
  of the 68 scoped tables, applies `SET DEFAULT '<default-org-
  uuid>'` (preserves ship gate — INSERTs that omit `org_id`
  silently land in default), `SET NOT NULL`, `ADD CONSTRAINT
  fk_<t>_org … REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT`,
  and `CREATE POLICY pol_<t>_org_scope … PERMISSIVE … USING
  (true)`. **RLS is NOT enabled** on the tables — v1.8.0 owns
  activation by `ALTER POLICY` to a real org filter + `ALTER TABLE
  … ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`. v1.7.0's final PR will `DROP
  DEFAULT` once every INSERT path is org-context-aware.

### Notes for operators

- **No operator action required.** Migrations are
  forward-only-idempotent and `default` org is created
  automatically. The install behaves as a single-tenant install
  did before, just with the multi-tenancy plumbing ready
  underneath.
- **Migration v36 caveat:** `SET NOT NULL` on a table with very
  many rows (audit_events, login_history at scale) runs a
  validation scan. v35 backfilled every existing row so the scan
  succeeds, but for the largest installs we recommend the
  migration runs during a maintenance window.
- `tools/orgscope` baseline (~1096 unscoped queries) is **not**
  a regression — it documents the surface v1.7.0 will refactor.
  The CI job posts the count informationally; PRs are not gated.

### What's NOT in this release

- No enforcement of org scoping. Service code still ignores
  `orgctx`. Queries do not filter by `org_id` yet. RLS is not
  enabled. (v1.7.0 owns the app-layer enforcement; v1.8.0 owns
  RLS.)
- No tenant signup UI, billing, hard quotas, per-tenant signing
  keys, schema/db-per-tenant — those are explicitly out of scope
  for the entire v2.0 epic; see the design doc.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-11

A docs-only release that closes the last open P2 backlog item from
the v1.0 plan. No code change; safe to skip if you're already on
v1.4.0 and don't need the new operator-facing docs.

### Added
- **`docs/SECURITY-HARDENING.md`** (#133). Production-readiness
  checklist where every "hard requirement" row maps to a check in
  `Config.ValidateProduction()` — the in-process blocking startup
  gate that already refuses to bring up a misconfigured production
  deploy. Covers the secrets / transport / CSRF-CORS-audit-stream /
  debug-knob sections the validator gates on, plus an "outside the
  validator" section for the operational items that aren't config
  flags. The policy at the bottom nails down validator-first,
  doc-update-in-the-same-PR.
- **`docs/SECURITY-TENANCY.md`** (#133). Explicit, prose statement
  of the single-tenant assumption the v1.0 plan made and the v1.x
  releases preserved. Describes what is shared (data layer,
  identity, authorization, audit), what we do support (federation
  across IdPs, per-app authz, per-customer deployments), and what
  we don't (row-level tenant isolation, per-tenant signing keys,
  per-tenant rate limits, per-tenant audit isolation) — and why
  each is intentional, not a gap.

### Changed
- **`SECURITY.md`** Deployment section trimmed (#133). The previous
  generic OWASP-ish bullet list duplicated marketing copy from the
  README and overlapped with the new hardening doc by 90%. Replaced
  with two pointers to `SECURITY-HARDENING.md` and
  `SECURITY-TENANCY.md` plus the lock-step policy. Vuln reporting
  and supported-versions sections are unchanged.
- **`README.md`** Overview (#133). Adds a prominent blockquote that
  states the single-tenant assumption in one sentence and links to
  `docs/SECURITY-TENANCY.md`. First-impression accuracy for readers
  who would otherwise spend time evaluating us against a multi-
  tenant SaaS use case we don't support.
- **`docs/GETTING-STARTED.md`** "Initialize Database" step (#133).
  The old step told operators to run `\i migrations/001_create_tables.sql`
  — a pre-historic flow. Replaced with the supported path: build
  `cmd/migrate`, run `migrate up`, verify with `migrate status`.
  Plus a top-of-doc callout pointing readers at the new hardening
  and tenancy docs before any production deploy.

### Notes
- v1.4.0 deployments upgrade in place. The release tags the v1.5.0
  binaries identically to v1.4.0; if you don't pull the docs, the
  upgrade is a no-op.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-11

A short, focused security-hardening release. Three independent P1/P2
items the v1.0 plan called out, each landed as its own commit with
defense-in-depth tests:

### Changed
- **Dynamic UPDATE builders now run behind a column allow-list**
  (#129). Both `updateSAMLServiceProvider`
  (`internal/oauth/saml_sp.go`) and the
  `/access/paths/:pathID/classification` handler
  (`internal/access/app_publish.go`) used to build their SQL with
  `fmt.Sprintf("col = $%d", argIdx)` scattered through one if-block
  per column. The literals were hardcoded so the pattern was not
  actively exploitable, but the blast radius was wide: one refactor
  wiring a request-derived string into a Sprintf would have introduced
  a real SQL-injection vector. The new `buildUpdateClause` helper
  takes a per-caller column allow-list, validates each candidate
  against both that map and a strict identifier regex
  (`^[a-z_][a-z0-9_]{0,62}$`), and refuses to build the query when
  anything else slips through. Unit tests pin the rejection paths.
- **Migration lock acquisition retries up to 30 s before giving up**
  (#130). Previously `acquireLock` returned instantly on conflict —
  fine for a single admin-driven `cmd/migrate up`, but it raced in
  containerized environments where the migrate job and the
  identity-service / oauth-service replicas were all coming up against
  the same database at startup. Whichever migrator won the race ran
  the migrations; every other process exited with "lock is already
  held" and the orchestrator restarted them in a crash loop. The lock
  now retries every 500 ms for up to 30 s before reporting failure.
  Stale-lock recovery (15 min) is unchanged. A real DB error (not
  `errLockBusy`) still surfaces on the first try — only conflicts
  retry. Six unit tests pin the new behavior including
  context-cancellation handling.
- **CSRF protection is on by default** (#131). The
  `csrf_enabled` default flipped from `false` to `true`. The
  production gate (`ValidateProduction`) caught the old default
  anyway, but every non-prod environment had to remember to opt in.
  Operators now opt out (`CSRF_ENABLED=false`) only when they know
  they need to.

### Fixed
- **`internal/access/ziti.go` was hardcoding
  `tls.Config{InsecureSkipVerify: true}` unconditionally** (#131).
  The line ran before the CA-loading branch, which then bolted a
  `RootCAs` pool onto the TLS config — but `InsecureSkipVerify=true`
  nullifies every CA after it, so the verification path was doing
  nothing for security and the connection was insecure regardless of
  the operator's intent. Replaced with:
  - Load `ZitiIdentityDir/ca.pem` → use it for proper validation
    (the desired path).
  - Missing CA + `ZitiInsecureSkipVerify=true` → log a warning and
    use `InsecureSkipVerify` (the dev-loop escape hatch).
  - Missing CA + `ZitiInsecureSkipVerify=false` → refuse to start
    with a hint pointing at both knobs (the production refusal).

### Security
- **`ValidateProduction()` now rejects two new misconfigurations**
  (#131):
  - `redis_tls_skip_verify=true`
  - `ziti_insecure_skip_verify=true`
  Both are dev-loop escape hatches against self-signed certs in a
  local docker stack; in production they silently erase the trust
  chain on the link they cover. The blocking startup gate
  (`security_check.ValidateProductionConfig`) now ensures production
  deploys can't ship with either flag on.

### Notes
- All v1.3.0 deployments upgrade in place. The CSRF default flip and
  the new skip-verify production gates are the only behavioral
  changes most operators will see; the SQL builder and migration lock
  refactors are internal.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-11

A focused follow-on release driven by the P1.5 backend-test sweep —
which surfaced (and made us fix) two real OAuth-flow bugs and one
missing schema migration that production deployments had been
silently broken on since the QR-login feature shipped.

### Added
- **Backend unit-test coverage on previously untested seams** (#122):
  - `internal/oauth/authorize_handler_test.go` — the methods on
    `*AuthorizeHandler` (`validateRedirectURI`, `validateResponseType`,
    `validateScope`, `validatePKCEParameters`, `parseAuthorizeRequest`)
    were 0% covered; new file takes them to 100% without bringing up
    a Service / Redis / DB.
  - `internal/common/netutil/ssrf_test.go` — entire package was
    untested. `DefaultSSRFConfig`, `ValidateURL` (scheme / localhost /
    private-IP / no-hostname / allowlist-miss branches),
    `domainMatches`, `isPrivateIP` (RFC 1918 + RFC 4193 boundaries),
    `isLocalhostIP`, `IsPrivateURL`, `KnownPublicAPIs` sanity. Uses
    literal IPs so the test stays off DNS. **Package coverage
    0 % → 66.2 %**.
  - `internal/common/events/bus_test.go` — entire package was
    untested. `Event` constructor + fluent setters + `JSON`,
    `MemoryBus` subscribe / wildcard / all / with-filter / unsubscribe /
    publish-returns-last-error / close-rejects-publish /
    `PublishAsync`-delivers, and the package-level global-bus wrappers.
    **Package coverage 0 % → 100 %**.
- **Integration coverage for stepup + passwordless** (#123, #126,
  #127). Two new test files (`test/integration/stepup_test.go`,
  `test/integration/passwordless_test.go`) exercise 13 routes /
  ~25 cases. The stepup happy-path round-trip and the QR-login
  create / poll happy paths are now part of the gating integration
  suite.
- **Database migration v33: `qr_login_sessions`** (#127). The table
  `internal/identity/passwordless.go` has been `INSERT`-ing into since
  the QR-login feature shipped — but which no migration ever created.
  Every `POST /oauth/qr-login/create` therefore 500'd at the first
  `INSERT` against "relation does not exist". Surfaced by PR #126's
  integration tests; was previously masked by the broken-session-id
  validator (see Fixed below). Schema mirrors the column set the
  package already reads/writes (id, unique session_token, qr_code_data,
  status enum, nullable user_id, JSONB device blobs, IP, four
  lifecycle timestamps) plus indexes on `(status, created_at)` and a
  partial `user_id` index for the post-scan lookups.

### Fixed
- **`/oauth/stepup-*` returned 401 for every valid bearer token**
  (#126, closes #124). The three step-up routes were registered
  against the bare `/oauth` group with no auth middleware in front of
  them. The handlers read `user_id` and `session_id` from the gin
  context — but nothing populated them, because no middleware ran the
  JWT parse. The fix wraps the routes with `authMiddleware` the same
  way the `/oauth/authorize` consent endpoint already does. As a
  defense-in-depth follow-on, `handleAuthorizationCodeGrant` also now
  falls back to a DB lookup for the user's most-recent active session
  when the Redis `authcode_session:<code>` bridge is empty, so the
  access token always carries a usable `sid` claim.
- **`isValidSessionID` rejected every real `login_session`** (#126,
  closes #125). The validator required a strict 36-character UUID,
  but `/oauth/authorize` produces `login_session` via
  `GenerateRandomToken(32)` — a 44-character padded base64url token.
  The mismatch broke QR login, MFA OTP, passkey, and magic-link-verify
  end to end against the actual auth flow. `isValidSessionID` now
  accepts either form: a 36-character UUID, OR a 32..128-character
  base64url token with optional `=` padding. Both still exclude `:`,
  `/`, whitespace, and control bytes — Redis-key injection / path
  traversal stays blocked. Unit tests expanded to 23 cases covering
  the UUID happy path, the base64url happy path with and without
  padding, length boundaries, and the full injection-shaped rejection
  set.

### Notes
- All v1.2.0 deployments upgrade in place. Migration v33 applies on
  startup through the standard migration runner; the table is empty
  on first use and the OAuth service starts populating it
  immediately.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-10

A follow-on minor release closing the rest of the P1 and P2 backlog items
queued behind v1.1.0, plus a full sweep through the admin-console test
suite. Every admin-console page is now covered.

### Added
- **GDPR DSAR processor.** `Service.ExecuteDSAR` now actually fulfills
  data-subject access requests instead of marking them "received":
  - `export` (Article 15) compiles 12 categories of subject data (profile,
    consents, sessions, audit events, roles, groups, app assignments,
    access requests, MFA TOTP, MFA WebAuthn, MFA push, prior DSARs).
  - `delete` (Article 17) erases the subject's records.
  - `restrict` (Article 18) flags the subject for restricted processing.
  A background processor (`StartDSARProcessor`) auto-executes new `export`
  requests; `delete` and `restrict` stay manual on purpose. Backed by
  schema migration v32 (privacy tables) (#118).
- **Outbound resilience.** New `internal/common/resilience` package wraps
  external OAuth / SAML / OIDC discovery calls behind a circuit breaker
  (`ResilientHTTPClient` + per-host `Registry`). Long IdP outages no
  longer drag the whole login path down (#117).
- **Frontend test coverage: 100%.** Every page under
  `web/admin-console/src/pages/` (87 in total) now has a vitest suite.
  Suite is 114 files / 684 tests. Patterns established for fixtures with
  TanStack Query, Radix listeners, fetch-direct pages, route params, and
  `useAuth` mocks (#120).

### Changed
- **Application access requests are fulfilled end-to-end.** Approving an
  access request whose `resource_type == application` now provisions the
  application binding through `internal/provisioning`. Prior to this it
  marked the request approved and warned (#117).
- **Certification reviews now enforce decisions.** Reviewing an item
  with `decision == revoke` (whether per-item or via the campaign's
  `revokeUnreviewedItems`) actually revokes the underlying role / group /
  app assignment instead of just recording the decision (#117).

### Fixed
- **Session-cleanup race-detector flake.** `TestSessionService_Session-`
  `ExpirationCleanup` no longer relies on `miniredis.FastForward`, which
  raced the cleanup goroutine when `-race` was on. The test uses a real
  1 s TTL plus a 1.1 s sleep; the helper also closes its Redis client
  via `t.Cleanup` so leaked goroutines don't carry across tests (#119).

### Notes
- v1.1.0 deployments upgrade in place. The new privacy tables (migration
  v32) apply on startup through the standard migration runner.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-09

The first minor release after v1.0.0 — three weeks of post-release hardening
focused on real security gaps that integration tests surfaced, plus the
infrastructure to keep them from coming back.

### Added
- **`POST /api/v1/identity/users/:id/set-password`** — direct admin
  password-set endpoint. Hashes via `Service.SetPassword` so password-history
  and policy enforcement apply. Closes the "admin onboards a non-SSO user"
  gap that previously had no API path (#112).
- **`GET /api/v1/identity/users/me/sessions`** — the self-access counterpart
  of the existing admin-only `/users/:id/sessions`. Sources user id from the
  JWT (#114).
- **`GET /api/v1/identity/users/me/mfa/status`** — self-service MFA status
  endpoint. Returns the user's enabled primary factors as an array, distinct
  from the admin-console toggle map at `/mfa/methods`. Backup recovery codes
  are intentionally excluded — they're not a primary factor on their own
  (#114).
- **Integration test suite is now mandatory in CI**. The full 24-test suite
  (Postgres + Redis ephemeral services, real identity + oauth-service
  binaries) runs on every PR; any regression in identity / OAuth / MFA /
  WebAuthn / session flows blocks the merge (#115).

### Changed
- **Token revocation is now enforced at `/oauth/userinfo`.** PR #82 made
  `internal/auth.ValidateToken` fail-closed on revocation, but the OAuth
  service had its own JWT-parse path that never consulted the revocation
  store — `/oauth/revoke`, `/oauth/logout`, and `/oauth/logout-all` were
  redirect-theater. Now backed by two Redis-keyed mechanisms:
  - Per-token blacklist keyed by `sha256(token)`, TTL = remaining token
    lifetime. Used by `/oauth/revoke` and single-session `/oauth/logout`
    (when called with a Bearer).
  - Per-user revocation cutoff (`oauth:user_tokens_revoked_at:<userID>`).
    Used by `/oauth/logout-all` and by OIDC RP-initiated `/oauth/logout`
    when no Bearer is supplied — every token whose `iat ≤ cutoff` is
    rejected by `/oauth/userinfo` (#112, #114).
- **Refresh-token rotation now happens on every `grant_type=refresh_token`
  exchange** (RFC 6749 §6 / RFC 6819 §5.2.2.3). A new random refresh token
  is issued, the old one is deleted *after* the new one's INSERT succeeds,
  and the response carries the rotated token. Clients that don't store the
  rotated token will get `invalid_grant` on the next refresh — this is the
  intended security improvement (#114).
- **`Service.CreateUser` now mirrors the generated UUID back to the
  caller's struct**, so `c.JSON(201, user)` returns a usable `id` and the
  downstream "user.created" webhook + email-verification token insert see a
  real value instead of an empty string (#112).
- **SCIM `active` field now properly maps to the database `enabled` column**
  in `FromUser`. Previously, SCIM-conformant clients posting
  `{"active": true}` silently created users with `enabled=false`, and every
  admin handler queried `WHERE enabled = true` (#112).
- `handleAdminSetPassword` validates `:id` as a UUID up-front (#112).
- `handleRevoke` now signature-verifies the access token before blacklisting
  it (closes a CodeQL "missing JWT signature check" finding) (#112).

### Database
- **Migration v30**: `ALTER TABLE user_roles ADD COLUMN expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ`.
  The column was already referenced by `GenerateJWT` and the role-expiry
  cleaner, but never existed in the v1 schema — every JWT issuance returned
  an empty `roles` claim, which then 403'd the post-#79 admin-API authz gate
  (#105).
- **Migration v31**: `ALTER TABLE oauth_refresh_tokens ADD COLUMN session_id
  UUID`. The column was added when session-bound rotation landed but never
  made it into the schema migrations. Postgres rejected every INSERT, the
  error was swallowed in `handleAuthorizationCodeGrant`, and clients got
  refresh tokens that were never persisted — every `grant_type=refresh_token`
  then 400'd with `invalid_grant` (#114).

### Fixed
- `audit-service` registers the Redis health check it had been silently
  missing — every other service in the fleet was already checking Redis (#109).
- SAML SP metadata: corrected SA5008 XML tag conflicts on
  `Organization{Name,DisplayName,URL}` (#99).
- `internal/oauth/service.go` and `internal/identity/service.go` cleared
  CodeQL "log entries from user input" findings introduced by the new admin
  endpoints (#112).
- Ratelimit test window flake (#98).
- Frontend type-check and test command scripts (#88, #89).
- Race-condition CI job added (#91).
- CVE bumps: Go toolchain 1.25.11, `go-jose/v4` 4.1.4 (#104, #97).

### Test coverage
- `internal/migrations` unit tests for `allMigrations()` integrity (versions
  contiguous, no gaps, no empty SQL) and `splitSQL` behavior pins (#111).
- `internal/oauth.generateStepUpToken` sign/verify round-trip + claim
  shape (#111).
- `internal/oauth.isValidSessionID` regex-gate locked down across 15 cases
  including path traversal, separator injection, newline injection (#111).
- Frontend smoke coverage on top admin pages (#101).

### Docs
- `docs/PRODUCTION-READINESS.md` — end-to-end "can I deploy this?"
  assessment, 35-item pre-deployment checklist, full feature inventory,
  known-gaps register, deployment paths for Docker Compose / Helm /
  Terraform-EKS (#113).

### Upgrade notes
- **OAuth clients** with refresh tokens: after upgrade, the first
  `grant_type=refresh_token` exchange rotates the token. Persist the new
  `refresh_token` from the response; the old one is invalidated. Clients
  that ignore the rotated token will fail at the *second* refresh, not the
  first — make sure your client code stores the new value.
- **Browser SPAs** relying on the legacy "access token survives logout"
  bug: after upgrade, RP-initiated logout actually kills the access token.
  This is the desired behavior; UI flows that depended on the old leak
  should be reviewed.
- **Database**: two new migrations (v30, v31). Both are
  `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` with nullable columns — backward
  compatible, fast on production-sized tables, no downtime required.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-22

The first tagged release: a hardened, single-tenant, self-hostable v1.

### Added
- Production deployment runbook (`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`) anchored to the
  `ValidateProduction()` startup gate.
- Observability stack wired into the canonical compose file (Prometheus,
  Alertmanager, Grafana with provisioned dashboards, Loki/Promtail, Jaeger).
- GHCR image pipeline: multi-arch (amd64/arm64) images published to
  `ghcr.io/mhmtgngr/openidx/<service>` on every `main` push and `vX.Y.Z` tag,
  now version-stamped (the tag or commit SHA) and surfaced at `/health`.
- Helm `values-prod.yaml` (pinned tags, autoscaling, NetworkPolicies, external
  secrets, managed datastores) and a Helm chart CI workflow.
- Terraform remote-state backend bootstrap (`deployments/terraform/bootstrap/`)
  and a Terraform fmt/validate CI workflow.
- Compile gate for the build-tagged integration test suite, plus an ephemeral
  Postgres/Redis integration-test CI job.
- Backup/restore: real S3 upload and restore-from-S3 wired through the
  `Storage` interface (the previously-unused `S3Storage` backend), with a
  corrected disaster-recovery runbook.

### Changed
- Project status / feature docs rewritten to reflect the real (much more
  complete) state of the codebase.
- Adopted golangci-lint v2 and cleared the lint backlog: enforced `gofmt`,
  `govet`, `ineffassign`, `unconvert`, `bodyclose`, `staticcheck` (SA bug-class)
  and `unused`; removed dead code. `errcheck` remains intentionally deferred
  (dominated by intentional fire-and-forget calls and optional request-body
  binds).

### Fixed
- Frontend `eslint` configuration repaired; 18 stale frontend tests fixed
  (full suite green).
- Security Scanning workflow no longer reports false-red (image-scan gating;
  Semgrep SARIF upload made non-blocking).
- Backup storage: removed misleading "not initialized" panic placeholders and
  added the package's first tests.
- Schema migrations recover a stale advisory lock (from a crashed holder)
  instead of deadlocking on startup.

### Security
- **Identity admin API now enforces authorization.** The `/api/v1/identity`
  routes are deny-by-default: self-service paths (`/users/me`, MFA enrollment,
  trusted browsers, risk assessment, resend-verification) remain available to
  the authenticated user, but every other identity route now requires the
  `admin`/`super_admin` role. Previously these routes were authenticated but
  not authorized.
- **Token revocation is now enforced.** `RevokeUserTokens` previously wrote a
  per-user revocation marker that was never consulted; tokens issued before a
  revocation are now rejected. Added opt-in fail-closed validation
  (`WithRevocationRequired`) for production.
- **Auth endpoints fail closed under load-shedding.** The distributed rate
  limiter now rejects auth-sensitive requests (login, token, OTP, magic-link,
  password-reset, step-up) when its Redis backend is unavailable, instead of
  silently failing open, and covers more sensitive paths.

### Known limitations (v1)
- **Single-tenant.** One organization per deployment; multi-tenant SaaS
  isolation is not implemented.
- OAuth token introspection does not yet reflect revocation; access-token
  revocation propagates within the access-token TTL (15 min).
- Several built-but-unwired features remain (flagged `TODO(unwired)` in code):
  session idle/absolute-timeout enforcement, SAML SLO session tracking,
  reverse-proxy hop-by-hop header stripping, and audit-stream SIEM config
  endpoints.
