/**
 * Rendering helpers for `enrolled_agents.compliance_score`.
 *
 * The field is a 0.0-1.0 fraction: the agent report handler computes it as
 * `scoreSum / weightSum` (internal/access/agent_api.go) and the API returns it
 * verbatim. Two facts about it caused three separate display defects, so the
 * conversion lives here once instead of at each call site.
 *
 * 1. It must be multiplied by 100 to be a percentage. Two pages rendered
 *    `Math.round(score)%` directly, so a fully compliant device (1.0) showed
 *    as "1%" -- the worst possible misreading, since it looks like a real
 *    measurement of near-total failure.
 *
 * 2. It defaults to 0 when nothing has ever been reported. The column default
 *    is 0.0 and `compliance_status` defaults to 'unknown', so an agent that
 *    has never checked in is indistinguishable on screen from one that
 *    reported and scored nothing. Measured on the live database (2026-08-14):
 *    10 of 16 agents are 'unknown' with score 0, and the field report from
 *    the same day called this out as a suspicious "0%".
