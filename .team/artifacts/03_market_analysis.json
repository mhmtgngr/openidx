  "summary": "The global IAM market is projected to grow from $25.96 billion in 2025 to $42.61 billion by 2030 at a 10.4% CAGR, driven by zero-trust adoption, AI-powered access controls, hybrid work models, and cloud migration. Market leaders Microsoft Entra ID (\u00a393-192/user/month), Okta ($6-17+/user/month), Ping Identity, SailPoint, and CyberArk dominate with comprehensive features but at premium pricing with vendor lock-in. OpenIDX's key competitive advantage is 70-80% cost savings through open-source delivery while maintaining enterprise-grade capabilities including OAuth/OIDC, SCIM 2.0 provisioning, OPA policy engine, and microservices architecture. Critical gaps include AI-powered anomaly detection, JIT access, and comprehensive compliance reporting\u2014features that differentiate enterprise competitors but present implementation opportunities. Emerging trends favor OpenIDX: zero trust becoming mainstream, API-first IAM adoption, and enterprises seeking cost-optimized alternatives to proprietary solutions create favorable market conditions. Chinese competitors like \u817e\u8bafiOA (\u00a559/year) prove aggressive pricing disrupts markets, while Western vendors' complex licensing creates opportunity for transparent, open-source positioning. Priority recommendations include compliance report templates (critical enterprise requirement), JIT access (high security value), and AI anomaly detection (future-proofing) to compete effectively beyond price differentiation."
