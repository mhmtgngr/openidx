// SCIM group membership.
//
// Group membership lives in `group_memberships`, but until now no SCIM group
// handler read or wrote it. `GetGroup` selects from `groups` alone, so
// `group.Members` was always empty; `UpdateGroup` writes name/description/flags
// and nothing else. The consequences ran through every group operation:
//
//   - GET /Groups/:id reported every group as empty, so Entra ID and Okta
//     concluded the roster had been wiped externally and queued the whole
//     membership again on each sync cycle.
//   - PATCH with `add members` mutated the in-memory struct, answered 200, and
//     echoed the new member back in the response body — while the database was
//     untouched. The client had written confirmation of a membership that did
//     not exist.
//   - POST /Groups with members created an empty group and reported success.
//
// Provisioning a user into a group is the single most-used SCIM operation, and
// it was the one that did nothing. The filtered-path parser is what lets a
// client *express* "remove this member"; this file is what makes it happen.
//
// Changes go through AddGroupMember / RemoveGroupMember rather than raw SQL, so
// the max-member limit, the existence checks and the audit trail apply exactly
// as they do for the console.
