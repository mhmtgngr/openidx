# Fault matrix: for each origin failure mode, assert the pipeline's REACTION.
#
# The real OpenSecOps origin belongs to another team and currently flaps: on
# 2026-08-13 it answered /api correctly on only 4 of 60 tries. Waiting for
someone else to fix that is not a measurable loop, and testing against a
# moving target gives results that cannot be reproduced. So the outage is
# treated as an INPUT and reproduced locally, while the metric is our own
# reaction to it.
#
# THIS GATE IS DETERMINISTIC. It was not at first: the flapping case used the
# measured 7% success rate directly, so the matrix itself failed ~5% of runs
# (0.93^40) and reported 5/6 with nothing broken. I hit that live. A gate that
# cries wolf one run in twenty teaches people to ignore it, which is worse than
# having no gate, and "just re-run it" is how real regressions get waved through.
#
# Fixed by separating the two questions. The GATE asks a yes/no question -- does
# the loop survive a backend that only answers after many failures -- and uses a
# deterministic stand-in (success on exactly every 20th request; 20 > the old 12,
# so it still catches that defect, and < 40, so a correct loop always passes).
# The STATISTICAL question -- is 40 retries enough at the real 7% rate -- is a
# separate run and is not a pass/fail gate:
#
#   bash deployments/ci/faulttest/run-fault-matrix.sh --stat 12
#
# Nothing in the PIPELINE changed for this; the retry count stays 40. Only the
# test stopped being a coin toss.
# Repo root, so the script works from any checkout (it parses the pipeline YAML).
